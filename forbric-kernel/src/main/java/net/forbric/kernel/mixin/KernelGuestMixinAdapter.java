/**
 * Derives, per mixin config, which of its guest mixins must not apply to the merged base — the general form of
 * {@link MergedBaseMixinCompat#SUPPRESSED_MIXINS}'s hand-written entries.
 *
 * <p>A guest Fabric/Forge mixin is written against VANILLA bytecode. In the merged base, Forge or NeoForge may have
 * won the byte-merge of the class the mixin targets and restructured it — a field the mixin {@code @Shadow}s is
 * never assigned, an {@code @Inject} anchor moved, a param was re-typed. Generic erasure lets many such mixins APPLY
 * with no error and then misbehave at runtime (the archetype: {@code fabric-rendering-v1}'s {@code GuiRendererMixin}
 * reads {@code GuiRenderer.pictureInPictureRenderers}, which the NeoForge-won merge never assigns → NPE). Whether a
 * mixin applies cleanly is therefore not a usable signal.
 *
 * <p><b>Provenance is not a usable signal either.</b> This used to drop every mixin whose target matched a
 * hand-curated owned-class/package table. That was wrong at the root: the merged base IS NeoForge's patched
 * Minecraft ({@code MergedBaseBuilder} takes NeoForge as the base and splices Forge in — {@code forge=195
 * neo=10161 MERGED=611}), so "Forge/NeoForge owns this class" describes ~93% of the jar. Measured over the 163
 * suppressions that rule actually made, 108 targeted a class byte-identical to NeoForge's own jar, and restoring
 * them costs nothing. The table also could not see the failures that matter: fabric-block-api-v1 redirects
 * {@code BlockState.isAir()} inside {@code LevelChunkSection.setBlockState}, which the merged base calls as
 * {@code isEmpty()} — silently dead, on a class the table never listed.
 *
 * <p>So the question is asked directly instead: {@link MixinFit} resolves every anchor the mixin names — each
 * {@code @Shadow} member, each injector's target method, each {@code @At(target=…)} — against the merged target's
 * real bytecode, and reports whether they still exist. See {@link MixinFit.Result#shouldSuppress()} for why a
 * partially-resolving mixin is kept by default rather than dropped.
 *
 * <p>Two exemptions survive. PURE accessor/invoker mixins are always kept: they inject no behaviour, and other code
 * casts the target to the {@code @Accessor} interface they contribute. And whenever a mixin IS dropped, every mixin
 * depending on an interface it contributed is dropped with it — see {@link MixinFit#contributedInterfaces} — because
 * a lone drop converts the mod's {@code (Bar) foo} casts into {@code ClassCastException}s.
 *
 * <p>This runs at the point {@link ForbricMixinService} rewrites a config's JSON, so it needs no separate mod-jar
 * inventory: the config names its mixin package, and each mixin class is a game resource resolvable through the same
 * loader. Hand entries in {@link MergedBaseMixinCompat} stay authoritative for cases this cannot see (a runtime
 * break with no owned target); this removes the need to hand-list the owned-target ones.
