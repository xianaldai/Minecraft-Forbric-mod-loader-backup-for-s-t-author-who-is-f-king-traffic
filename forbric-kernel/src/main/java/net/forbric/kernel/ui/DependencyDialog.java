/**
 * Puts an unmet hard dependency in front of the player, instead of only in the log.
 *
 * <p>The log line was always there. It is one WARN in a ten-thousand-line file, and the failure it predicts
 * arrives much later wearing someone else's name: a pack whose BiomesOPlenty was missing TerraBlender logged
 * that requirement at boot, then died forty seconds afterwards on "Failed to load registries due to errors" —
 * 455 unknown block ids, an error naming neither mod. A player cannot be expected to connect those.
 *
 * <p>See {@link DependencyDialogMain} for why the dialog is a separate process on every platform.
 *
 * <h2>What it may and may not do</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code DependencyAudit} states the policy this belongs to: it reports, it never refuses, because one bad
 * declaration must not cost a player every other mod. A dialog does not change that — the kernel still loads
 * everything, and "Launch anyway" is what happens on every path that is not a deliberate click on Quit: a
 * closed window, a dialog that fails to open, no display, a child that crashes, a timeout. The one case where
 * the boot stops is the player choosing to stop it, which is not the kernel refusing on their behalf.
 *
 * <p>Silent on a dedicated server and in any headless run. A server blocked on a dialog nobody can see is
 * strictly worse than the log line it replaces, and the gates run servers unattended.
 *
 * <h2>One window, not two</h2>
 *
 * <p>The audit no longer opens its window itself: it {@link #hold holds} the notice, and the launch's compatibility
 * decision shows it. When nothing needs a decision, that is the notice above, unchanged. When a confirmed required
 * loss does, the notice is folded into the {@link #confirm confirmation} -- the same child, the same layout -- whose
 * contract is the opposite one: only an explicit click on continue approves, and a closed window, a timeout, no
 * display or {@code -Dforbric.dependencyDialog=off} is a launch that was not approved. Either way the player is asked
 * once, and suspected findings only ever reach the details.

	 *       still needs an explicit continue, and with no window there is none: under the ask policy that launch
