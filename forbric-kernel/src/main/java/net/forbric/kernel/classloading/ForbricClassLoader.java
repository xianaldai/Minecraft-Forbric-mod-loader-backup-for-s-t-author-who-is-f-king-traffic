 * The kernel's single sovereign transforming class loader — the one and only loader that defines the game +
 * ecosystem classes, applying the unified transform pipeline as each class is defined.
 *
 * <p>This replaces Fabric's Knot (and Forge's ModLauncher/securemodules) with one flat, JPMS-free loader. It is
 * child-first for the jars it owns (the merged base + the Forge/NeoForge runtime carriers + the kernel's game-side
 * runtime jar + mod jars) and parent-first for everything shared with the boot side (ASM, Mixin, logging, the
 * kernel boot classes) — see {@link DelegationPolicy}.
 *
 * <p>The transform hook is injected by the boot orchestrator: {@code (binaryName, classBytes) -> newBytes}. It
 * runs the {@code TransformChain} (Access, merged-base compat, the kernel redirectors) and, last, Mixin. A
 * {@code null}/identity return means "unchanged".
