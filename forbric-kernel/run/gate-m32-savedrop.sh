# M32 — a world written by a set of mods still opens when one of them is GONE.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. run/make-test-world.sh states the asymmetry in its own header: "a save may be opened by a
# superset of the mods that wrote it; the reverse is what rots." Nothing tested the reverse. Every gate in this
# tree opens a world with the mods that made it, and a player's mods folder changes constantly — a mod is
# removed, a pack is updated, a jar is disabled to bisect a crash. When that goes wrong on a loader the symptom
# is not a message, it is a world that will not open, and "Forbric ate my save" and "Forbric does not support my
# mod" are the same sentence to the person saying it.
#
# The mod dropped is mcw-bridges, chosen because it registers hundreds of blocks and items: the save genuinely
# contains its content, so the second boot has to resolve references to a mod that is no longer there. Dropping
# a mod whose content never reached the region files would make this gate pass without asking anything.

# The scheduler hands this gate M32_PORT from its own block, as it does for every # GATE-PARALLEL gate. The
# fallback is for a run started by hand, and it deliberately sits OUTSIDE the scheduler's block (PORT_BASE 25700
# up), because 25805 was also slot 10's M16_PORT: from -j 11 up the two gates could take one port, and whichever
# lost it went red for a reason that had nothing to do with the kernel.
