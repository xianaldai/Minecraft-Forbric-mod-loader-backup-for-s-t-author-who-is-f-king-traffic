"""Scheduler behind gates-all.sh: run the checked-in gates with as much overlap as the machine allows.

WHY A SCHEDULER AND NOT `xargs -P`. The gates are not independent processes that happen to be slow. Each one
boots a real Minecraft server or client, and three things make a naive fan-out produce GREEN runs that prove
nothing:

  * THE PORT. Eighteen gates call seed_server_properties, which writes GATE_PORT into server.properties. Two of
    them at once and the loser prints "FAILED TO BIND TO PORT" and then still prints "Stopping server" -- so the
    clean-shutdown assertion passes and the gate reads green while its server never existed. lib.sh documents
    this exact failure. Every concurrent gate therefore gets its own port block, not a shared default.
  * THE RUNDIR. gate-m1, gate-m2 and gate-m3 all use run/server-kernel. Two gates in one rundir stage each
    other's mods, truncate each other's server.properties and read each other's logs. Gates that share a
    rundir are never run together.
  * THE ONE RUNDIR WORTH COPYING. Four gates want run/client-merged-pack, a 97-jar install with a world in it,
    and serialising them left the last two minutes of a run with a single gate in it. They get a COPY each
    instead: on APFS `cp -Rc` clones that 434 MB directory in 0.17s and shares its blocks until something is
    written, so four private copies cost no disk and no wait. A gate asks for one by declaring
    `clone=<dir>:<VAR>`, and the scheduler points <VAR> at the copy.
  * THE MEMORY. Every kernel JVM is launched without -Xmx, so each one inherits an ergonomic 4 GB ceiling. Four
    clients on a 16 GB machine is not a test result, it is a swap storm. Each gate declares what it costs and
    the scheduler keeps the running set inside a budget.

A gate that does not declare itself runs ALONE. That is the safe direction to be wrong in: a new gate added by
someone who never read this file is slow, not silently broken. It says so on stderr when it happens.

-j 1 is exactly the old sequential behaviour: same order, same summary.txt, same exit code.

--release IS AN ACCEPTANCE, NOT A SWEEP. An ordinary sweep reports an explicit --skip as SKIP and a declared
EXPECTED_RED as itself, and exits 0 when nothing else is red -- the right answer while developing. For a release
both are the same fact: a gate whose assertions did not pass. So in release mode either one makes the exit code 1,
and its RESULT line says why, because a gate that was never run cannot be counted as passing.

STDOUT IS STILL ONLY THE RESULT LINES. A run now takes minutes with several gates interleaved, so there is a
lot worth saying while it happens -- but gates-all.sh's output is asserted to equal summary.txt byte for byte
(GatesAllTest), and the probe harness merges stderr into it, so neither stream is free. The running commentary
goes to <results>/progress.log instead, which `tail -f` reads live, and `--progress` also mirrors it to stderr
for an interactive run.

# Port blocks are handed out one per CONCURRENT SLOT, not one per gate: slot i gets PORT_BASE + i*PORT_STRIDE.
