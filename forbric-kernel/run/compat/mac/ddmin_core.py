"""Delta debugging for a failing mod pack: the pure part, with the game behind an oracle.

ddmin() is Zeller and Hildebrandt's ddmin2 ("Simplifying and Isolating Failure-Inducing Input", 2002). An oracle
maps a configuration (a list of jar names) to FAIL, PASS or UNRESOLVED. Only FAIL reduces: a run that broke some
other way says nothing about the failure being minimised, so treating it as either verdict would let the search
walk off to a different bug. The game-running driver (ddmin.py) is a later step; nothing here reads the
environment, the filesystem or a clock.
