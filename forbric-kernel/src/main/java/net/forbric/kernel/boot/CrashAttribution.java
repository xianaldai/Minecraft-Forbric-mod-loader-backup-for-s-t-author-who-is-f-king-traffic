/**
 * After a crash, says which mods it might be.
 *
 * <p>Minecraft writes a crash report and nothing in it answers the only question a player has. The Forge line
 * that would — {@code Suspected Mods:} — is produced by walking a {@code ModuleLayer} of {@code IModInfo}, which
 * this kernel deliberately does not have ({@code KernelForgeModContext}), so on a Forbric instance it says
 * {@code NONE} when it appears at all. Measured across every crash report in {@code run/}: not one names a mod.
 * Meanwhile the trace itself is full of the answer — the top frame of six of six crashes in {@code client-popular}
 * belongs to a mod jar by name.
 *
 * <h2>It reads the report; it does not catch the crash</h2>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not an uncaught-exception handler. Minecraft catches its own fatal throwable, writes the report
 * and calls {@code System.exit} ({@code Minecraft.crash} is two instructions: save, then exit), so a handler of
 * ours would never see the crashes that matter. Running from a shutdown hook instead means the file is already
 * on disk, complete, and is the same evidence a player would paste into a bug report. It also costs nothing on
 * every boot that does not crash.
 *
 * <h2>It joins; it never parses a mod id out of a name</h2>
 *
 * <p>A jar file name is not a mod id — {@code xaeroworldmap-forge-26.2-1.46.1.jar} carries ids from the
 * {@code xaerominimap} family, and jars renamed to a content hash are real. So every name found in the trace is
 * looked up in {@link ModCatalog}, and a name no row carries contributes nothing. That also supplies the
 * deny-list for free: the merged base, the runtime carriers, the kernel's own jar and Minecraft's libraries are
 * not mods, so they are not in the catalogue, so they cannot be blamed.
 *
 * <p>Same rule for the other two forms. {@code MixinConfigOwners}' policy is the one this inherits: a
 * confidently wrong mod name is worse than no mod name.
