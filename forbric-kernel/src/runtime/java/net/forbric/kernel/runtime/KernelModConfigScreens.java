/**
 * Opens a mod's config screen, whichever ecosystem it came from.
 *
 * <h2>Why three answers and not one</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is no cross-loader config screen SPI, and the three that exist do not resemble each other. NeoForge
 * registers an {@code IConfigScreenFactory} as an extension point on the mod's container. Traditional
 * MinecraftForge registers a {@code ConfigScreenHandler.ConfigScreenFactory} record holding a
 * {@code BiFunction<Minecraft, Screen, Screen>}. Fabric has no config SPI at all — Fabric mods register with
 * <em>Mod Menu</em>, which is itself a mod, so the registry lives in a class this kernel cannot compile against
 * and may not be installed. When it is not, the registrations themselves — each mod's {@code "modmenu"}
 * entrypoint — are still there to be read, and are (see {@link ModMenu}).
 *
 * <p>Each screen therefore answers for its own family and no other. That is why Mod Menu opens Fabric mods'
 * configs and nothing else: it asks its own registry, which only Fabric mods can register in. Nothing is wrong
 * with it. The answer for an instance running three loaders is to ask all three registries, which is this class.
 *
 * <h2>Linkage</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each family's lookup is typed, and lives in its own nested class so that it LOADS on its own. A single
 * method naming both families would fail to link on an instance carrying one of them, and the failure would be a
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError} when a player clicks Config — for a mod of the family that IS present. Mod Menu
 * stays reflective because it is a third-party mod, not a staged artifact.

	 * requiring one. When it is installed it is asked, exactly as before — it is what a plain Fabric instance asks.
	 *
	 * <p>When it is not, this used to answer "no config" for every Fabric mod, and that was wrong in a way the player
	 * could see: the mods still DECLARE their screens, in a {@code "modmenu"} entrypoint implementing Mod Menu's API.
	 * The kernel stands in for that API ({@code ModMenuApiStandIn}), so those entrypoints link, and
	 * {@link ModMenuConfigFactories} reads them the way Mod Menu's own initializer does. In a player's 40-mod pack with no
	 * Mod Menu, Fabric mods with a Config button went from 0 to 16 of 24, and 15 of the 16 opened their own screen when
 * pressed; Voxy's own factory declined on that machine, which its log said it does where it cannot run.
