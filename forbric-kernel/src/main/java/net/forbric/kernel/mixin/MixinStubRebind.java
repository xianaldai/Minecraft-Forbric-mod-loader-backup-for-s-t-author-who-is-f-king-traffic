/**
 * Moves a mod's injector off a merge-added delegating stub onto the method that carries the body, when the mod was
 * compiled against a class where that signature was the body.
 *
 * <p>Mixin binds a selector without a descriptor to the FIRST declared method of that name (the selector's default
 * quantifier is one match; {@code TargetSelectors} stops there), and one with a descriptor to exactly that method. A
 * carrier that widened a vanilla method usually kept vanilla's signature in place as a stub —
 * {@code Player.getDestroySpeed(BlockState)} is {@code return getDestroySpeed(state, null)} on the merged base — and
 * put the body in the new overload after it. A Fabric mod was compiled against vanilla, where that one method IS the
 * body, so its injector lands on the stub: an anchor inside the body is simply missing, and a {@code HEAD} or
 * {@code RETURN} injection runs only when something calls the stub. Nothing on the merged base calls
 * {@code getDestroySpeed(BlockState)}: architectury's and Collective's break-speed events never fired.
 *
 * <p>The injector's selector moves to the delegate. A handler that captures the target's arguments is wrapped: the
 * outer takes the delegate's parameters and hands the original the stub's, read off the stub's own delegation call —
 * each stub parameter must reach the call unchanged, or nothing moves. Kept exactly:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>only along a row of {@code carrier-stubs.txt}: the stub's signature is vanilla's and the overload is the
 *       carrier's. Vanilla keeps stub-and-overload pairs of its own ({@code Minecraft.disconnect(Screen, boolean)}
 *       forwarding to the three-argument one) and a mod that chose the short one there meant it;</li>
 *   <li>only for a mod whose own platform ran that selector on code. A Fabric mod was compiled against vanilla, so
 *       it moves along every row. A MinecraftForge or NeoForge mod moves only where its carrier's own patched class
 *       has vanilla's signature as the body (or, for a name-only selector, only the widened overload) — the row's
 *       {@code forge=}/{@code neo=} column. Most rows are NeoForge's stubs over a signature MinecraftForge kept as the
 *       body: fusion's sprite capture on {@code ModelManager.loadModels} sat on the forwarding stub nothing calls,
 *       its static stayed null, and every block and item model on the client failed to bake. A mod whose carrier
 *       keeps the same stub itself (NeoForge mods on NeoForge's stubs) gets what it would get natively.
 *       {@code -Dforbric.mixinStubRebind.forgeFamily=off} moves Fabric mods' injectors only, as before;</li>
 *   <li>only a PURE stub: loads, constants, static fields, zero-argument static factories, non-capturing lambdas and
 *       method references (a constant, like a static field — NeoForge's {@code Language.loadFromJson(InputStream,
 *       BiConsumer)} passes a no-op component consumer) and argument construction, then one call to a same-name
 *       overload of the same class and static-ness, returning its result unchanged; the overload must have a body
 *       (an interface default forwarding to an abstract overload is no stub);</li>
 *   <li>every {@code INVOKE}/{@code FIELD}/{@code NEW} anchor absent from the stub and present in the delegate
 *       ({@code HEAD}, {@code RETURN} and {@code TAIL} are equivalent on both: the stub returns what the delegate
 *       returns);</li>
 *   <li>{@code @Inject} capturing nothing or exactly the stub's arguments, no locals capture; a MixinExtras
 *       {@code @Local} by a name the delegate's local variable table has in that type, or by its type alone (no name,
 *       ordinal, index or argsOnly) when, at every {@code INVOKE}/{@code FIELD} anchor in the delegate, exactly one
 *       local slot is of that type as Mixin's own walk down the method types it, the table names it there and that
 *       walk still holds it — MixinExtras then picks that one and nothing else. fusion's overlay-model hook takes the {@code ModelDiscovery} of
 *       {@code ModelManager.discoverModelDependencies} that way: the body is NeoForge's four-argument overload, where
 *       {@code result} is the only one ({@code -Dforbric.mixinStubRebind.typedLocal=off} leaves these where they
 *       are); an argsOnly {@code @Local} (by type, or type and ordinal) when the stub argument it picks is passed
 *       through as the delegate argument the same rule picks; a {@code @Share} in the mixin's own namespace only when
 *       every handler sharing that key on the stub moves to the same body, since MixinExtras allocates one value per
 *       target method. owo's lang hooks (a de-nesting wrap on {@code JsonObject.entrySet}, a rich-text wrap on
 *       {@code GsonHelper.convertToString} and a skip on {@code BiConsumer.accept}) pass three flags between them that
 *       way on {@code Language.loadFromJson}, whose body is NeoForge's three-argument overload; left on the stub,
 *       none of them attached and NeoForge rejected owo's nested keys, dropping every owo-based mod's whole lang file
 *       ({@code -Dforbric.mixinStubRebind.shared=off} leaves these where they are). No {@code @Group}, and never more
 *       anchors in the body than the injector's {@code allow};</li>
 *   <li>the {@code @At}-driven kinds only when every parameter past the injector's own contract — the value it
 *       modifies, or the receiver and arguments of the call it replaces or wraps — is a capture of the stub's LEADING
 *       arguments that the stub passes to the delegate at the same positions. Mixin lets any of these kinds take a
 *       prefix of the target's arguments after its own, and the rule used to read every one of them as part of the
 *       call: torrential's {@code @ModifyReturnValue} on {@code FuelValues.vanillaBurnTimes(Provider, FeatureFlagSet,
 *       int)} captures all three, the stub feeds the first two into a {@code Builder}, and moving it to
 *       {@code (Builder, int)} made MixinExtras reject the handler and the whole required mixin with it. It now
 *       stays on the stub, where it binds, and is reported SUSPECTED: it then runs only where something calls the
 *       stub. The merged dedicated server builds its fuel without calling it; the kernel's fuel bridge
 *       ({@code KernelFabricFuel.throughVanillaReturnHooks}) now calls it there, so this one runs on both sides unless
 *       {@code -Dforbric.fabricFuel.returnHooks=off} ({@code -Dforbric.mixinStubRebind.stubFinding=off} drops the
 *       finding); puzzleslib's {@code getDestroySpeed(float, BlockState)} still moves,
 *       because the stub passes its {@code BlockState} straight through as the delegate's first argument. When the
 *       contract's size cannot be told, nothing moves;</li>
 *   <li>a {@code @ModifyVariable} only by one {@code name} (never {@code ordinal}/{@code index}, which count locals by
 *       type across a body the carrier widened), at {@code LOAD}/{@code STORE} with no slice, when the stub has no
 *       local of that name and the delegate's table has it in one slot of the handler's type, accessed while live more
 *       times than the {@code @At}'s ordinal. torrential's Conduit Power mining bonus names {@code speed} in
 *       {@code Player.getDestroySpeed}; the merged stub has no {@code speed}, the body is the overload the game calls,
 *       and the bonus silently never applied. {@code -Dforbric.mixinStubRebind.modifyVariable=off} leaves these where
 *       they are.</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@code -Dforbric.mixinStubRebind=off} leaves every selector as compiled.
