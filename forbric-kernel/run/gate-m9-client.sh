# M9 gate — the CLIENT half. A tri-ecosystem instance must reach a rendered world and leave it cleanly.
#
# Every client fix in this kernel was verified by launching the game and reading the log by hand, so none of them
# was protected against the next change. This gate is that protection: it drives a real client into a real world
# with -Dforbric.clientSmoke, then asserts the absence of each failure that has actually cost a world load here.
# Those check_absent lines are the point of the gate — they are a list of bugs, each one paid for.
#
# WHY IT KILLS BY PID. A developer (or a second agent session) may have their own Minecraft client open, and a
# name-matched kill would take it down with no warning and no way to tell whose it was. This gate kills the
# process tree it started and nothing else. The server gates now do the same, via await_server in lib.sh.
#
# The window between disconnect and exit is deliberate. Vanilla's own watchdog logs "Client shutdown from
# post-main" ~15s after main returns if a non-daemon thread is still alive, which is how a leaked mod thread
# announces itself — so the gate waits for the process to end on its own rather than killing it at the disconnect.

# "Cannot get config value before config is loaded", thrown wherever it first asked. ShoulderSurfing asks from a
# mixin in Minecraft.<init>, so the whole client dies.
# This used to assert that the LATE pass opened 18 configs. It did -- and then loadEarlyConfigs, which runs after
# it used to, opened all 18 again through ConfigTracker.loadConfigs (a sweep of the whole type that does not skip
# a config with a loaded one). So the assertion pinned the double open: 36 "Opening a config that was already
# loaded" warnings per boot on the main thread, ModConfigEvent.Loading delivered twice to every one of those mods,
# each file re-read and a second watcher installed. The early pass now runs first and covers them, so the late
# pass correctly finds nothing left -- which is why the count assertion had to go rather than be retargeted.
#
# What is asserted instead is the OUTCOME: the early pass ran over both types, the config that used to crash the
