/**
 * Builds a single MERGED patched-Minecraft base carrying BOTH the traditional-MinecraftForge and the NeoForge
 * injections, so Forbric can run Forge + NeoForge + Fabric mods in ONE instance (the tri-in-one goal). The two
 * ecosystems patch the SAME {@code net.minecraft} classes with different hooks, and one game jar can hold only
 * one version of each class — so the merge happens here, at the bytecode (ASM) level.
 *
 * <p>"Modified by ecosystem X" is decided by a HOOK-REFERENCE signal — does the member carry an instruction/
 * interface/superclass referencing {@code net.minecraftforge}/{@code net.neoforged} — rather than a byte-level
 * diff against vanilla. This matters because the two patched jars come from DIFFERENT decompile+recompile
 * pipelines (MCPConfig/ForgeFlower vs NeoForm/Vineflower): a normalized bytecode diff false-positives on nearly
 * every method (different local-variable slots, lambda desugaring, instruction selection) even when neither
 * side touched it. A pipeline cannot invent an ecosystem package reference that wasn't a genuine injected hook,
 * so the reference itself is the reliable "was this actually patched" signal.
 *
 * <p>Strategy, per {@code net.minecraft}/{@code com.mojang} class:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>only one side hooks it</b> &rarr; take that side's class wholesale.</li>
 *   <li><b>both hook it</b> &rarr; base = the NeoForge-patched class; splice in every Forge-ADDED member
 *       (method/field absent on the Neo side) and every method where ONLY Forge injected a hook; MERGE the
 *       {@code implements} list (both ecosystems' extension interfaces); a method where BOTH sides inject a hook
	 *       attempts the restricted three-way merge in {@link AdditiveMethodMerger}; if it declines, keeps the
	 *       Neo body and reports both the lost hook and why the additive merge declined.</li>
 *   <li><b>neither hooks it</b> &rarr; take vanilla (or whichever patched side happens to carry the class).</li>
 * </ul>
 * Forge's baked-in {@code net.minecraftforge} classes are copied wholesale (Neo does not touch that namespace);
 * {@code net.neoforged} comes from the separate neoforge runtime at launch.
 *
 * <p>Usage: {@code MergedBaseBuilder <vanilla.jar> <forge-patched.jar> <neo-patched.jar> <out.jar> [report.txt]}

	 * <p>A lambda body is spliced by the same "the other side hooked here and the base did not" rule as any other
	 * method, and that rule is wrong for a lambda: a lambda is not called, it is NAMED — by the method handle in
	 * its capturing method's {@code invokedynamic}. So when the base keeps {@code M} and the other side's
	 * {@code lambda$M$N} wins the splice, {@code M}'s own call site silently resolves to a body from the other
	 * compile, and the button does whatever the OTHER side's button did.
	 *
	 * <p>That is not theoretical and it is not rare enough to ignore. On NeoForge 26.2.0.88 it made
	 * {@code PauseScreen}'s "Save and Quit to Title" open the mods list: NeoForge's patch shifted the lambda
	 * numbering by one, so MinecraftForge's mods-button {@code lambda$createPauseMenu$11(Button)} collided with
	 * vanilla's disconnect lambda of the same name and descriptor, won the splice, and the disconnect button's
	 * {@code invokedynamic} — still NeoForge's, since NeoForge's {@code createPauseMenu} was kept — resolved to
	 * it. An exhaustive scan of the merged base found seven of these across 10,956 two-sided classes, every one
	 * of them a Forge body reached from a Neo-kept method, including {@code TitleScreen.init}.
	 *
	 * <p>The rule is exact rather than heuristic: the capturing method's body is compared against both sides, and
	 * only when it matches one of them (so its side is known) is each captured lambda forced to that same side.
	 * A method whose body matches neither — spliced, rewritten, repaired elsewhere in this builder — is left
	 * alone, because its side is not a fact.
	 *
	 * <p>The displaced body is not re-homed: its only caller was the capturing method that lost, so nothing kept
	 * can still reach it. When a lambda is genuinely captured from BOTH sides' surviving methods the choice is
	 * real, and that is recorded as a conflict instead of being made silently — it has not happened yet.
