# M45 — the things every player does: craft, smelt, brew, swim, meet the Ender Dragon. Each of them threw on the merged base.
#
#   crafting remainders — fabric-item-api-v1's class tweaker injects FabricItem into Item, whose merged hierarchy has
#     MinecraftForge's IForgeItem; both default getCraftingRemainder(ItemStack), so with fabric-api installed every
#     crafting-table result, brew and bucket fuel threw IncompatibleClassChangeError (InterfaceDefaultConflictRepair now
#     judges a conflict against the jar's own interfaces and settles this one through NeoForge's overload).
#   smelting — NeoForge's furnace tick calls MinecraftForge's instance canBurn/consumeFuel/burn as static: every furnace
#     threw on its first smelt (FurnaceTickCallsInjector calls them on the ticked furnace).
#   the Ender Dragon — its parts were MinecraftForge PartEntitys while every consumer is NeoForge-typed; NeoForge's
#     getParts() answered null, so adding a dragon threw and a server holding one could not stop (DragonPartsInjector).
# A dedicated server with a probe mod (canary/everyday-actions) and the unmodified fabric-item-api-v1:
#   remainders through ItemStack, Item(ItemStack) and NeoForge's Item(ItemInstance) (control); a cake crafted from its
#   recipe leaves three buckets; an idle furnace ticks (control) and a lit one smelts raw iron; a brewing stand makes
#   awkward potions; a pig stands in a Fabric mod's untagged fluid (no interaction) and in its water-tagged fluid (it
#   swims), and MinecraftForge's fluid type of each is its water or empty type; a dragon is added and found by its part, hurt through it, and removed; the server stops cleanly.
#   Fabric fuels — fabric-content-registries fires its fuel events from vanilla's vanillaBurnTimes, which the merged
#     game never calls (it builds fuels from NeoForge's data map), so a Fabric mod's fuel could not go in a furnace
#     (FabricFuelValuesInjector runs them on NeoForge's builder): coal (control), the probe mod's dirt fuel, and the
#     carpets its exclusion removes.
#   Fabric fluids — a Fabric mod's fluid declares no NeoForge FluidType, and NeoForge's lookup threw "Mod fluids must
#     override getFluidType" at the first entity to touch one: 'Ticking entity' took the server down
#     (ForeignFluidTypeInjector gives it the type its fluid tags imply).
#
#   1. positive — STRICT, every case passes, zero confirmed required findings, no exception on stop.
#   2. off — -Dforbric.defaultConflictRepair=off -Dforbric.furnaceTickCalls=off -Dforbric.dragonParts=off
#      -Dforbric.foreignFluidTypes=off -Dforbric.fabricFuel=off -Dforbric.forgePartTracking=off: exactly the
#      repaired cases fail and the controls hold.
#      forgePartTracking is in that list because since 86c93b6c the dragon's null NeoForge getParts() is guarded twice:
#      ForgePartTrackingInjector reads it as no parts in the server's tracking callbacks. With only dragonParts off the
#      dragon is then added without its parts (dragon.add still fails: part lookup=null), and hurting it through a part
#      and removing it no longer throw, so dragon.hurt and dragon.remove passed and the first nightly went red on the
#      control, not on a repair. Both switched off, the three dragon cases fail as they did before (measured).
# Not covered here: a client (the dragon's parts in the client's entity lookups), and a native server as an oracle.
