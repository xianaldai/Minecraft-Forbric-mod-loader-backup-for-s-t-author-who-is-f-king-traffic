# Forbric — architecture and internals

English | [简体中文](introduction.zh-CN.md)

For mod and loader developers. This document is precise rather than gentle: it states what Forbric does, in the
order it does it, naming the real types and files. It describes the **`main` branch**, not a release; for what a
release contains and how a player installs it, read the [README](README.md).

> **Which code this describes.** The repository holds two generations. `forbric-kernel/` — the *sovereign
> kernel* — is what `main` ships and what `forbric-kernel-installer/` installs; it is the subject of this document.
> `forbric-loader/` is the first generation (the *weld*: real fabric-loader/Knot as host, with FML and
> FancyModLoader driven alongside it). It no longer runs in an installed instance, but it still builds the tools
> and staged artifacts the kernel is built and tested against — see [§14](#14-what-forbric-loader-is-still-for).

Terminology:

| Term | Meaning here |
| --- | --- |
| **ecosystem** | Fabric, traditional MinecraftForge, NeoForge — `net.forbric.api.Ecosystem.FABRIC` / `FORGE` / `NEOFORGE` |
| **Forge family** | MinecraftForge and NeoForge jointly. Two runtimes, two manifests (`META-INF/mods.toml`, `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml`), two event buses |
| **merged base** | `patched-mc-merged-26.2.jar`: Minecraft 26.2 carrying both Forge families' patches, byte-merged into one jar |
| **carrier** | one Forge family's runtime jar (`neoforge-runtime.jar`, `forge-runtime-interop.jar`), loaded as a passive ABI provider — its classes exist, its loader lifecycle never runs |
| **boot side / game side** | code loaded by the system class loader vs. code defined by `ForbricClassLoader` |
| **guest** | anything belonging to a third-party mod (guest mixin, guest jar) |

---

## 1. The problem

Three loaders assume they own the process. Running their mods together breaks in five independent ways, and
every part of the kernel answers one of them.

1. **Launch ownership.** Fabric starts Knot; MinecraftForge and NeoForge start ModLauncher/BootstrapLauncher with
   a JPMS module layer. Two transforming class loaders means two definitions of every game class.
2. **One class, three patch sets.** Both Forge families patch the *same* `net.minecraft` classes with different
   hooks, and a JVM can hold one version of each class. Something has to decide, per class and per method,
   whose body survives — and then live with what the loser's mods expect.
3. **Lifecycles and registration windows.** Each ecosystem has its own phases, its own bus, its own window in
   which registries are writable, and its own idea of when the freeze happens.
4. **Visibility.** Each loader keeps its own mod list. A mod asking its own loader "is Sodium installed?" or "which
   platform am I on?" gets an answer that is true for a single-loader instance and wrong here.
5. **Guest bytecode written for a different game.** A Fabric mixin was written against vanilla bytecode; a
   MinecraftForge mod against MinecraftForge's patched game. On the merged base, anchors have moved, methods have
   been split, fields re-typed, lambdas renumbered, superclasses swapped.

Namespace is *not* on this list for 26.2: the game ships Mojmap names, Forge-family 26.2 mods are Mojmap-compiled,
and so are Fabric's (`KernelMappingResolver`'s javadoc records a constant-pool scan of fabric-api and Jade finding
no intermediary symbols). The kernel runs identity mapping: `TransformContext(…, "named")`, and
`KernelMappingResolver` answers every lookup with its input.

Nor are mod APIs. Forbric does not re-implement the Fabric API, MinecraftForge or NeoForge APIs: a mod calls the
genuine Fabric API mod it installed, and the genuine MinecraftForge/NeoForge classes from the carriers. What the
kernel owns is the part a loader owns — class loading, discovery, the lifecycle, the registration window, and
Fabric Loader's own API (§5.1) — plus the repairs the merge makes necessary. Two of those repairs reproduce
behaviour instead of calling it: NeoForge's coremod rewrites, which the kernel performs itself (§5.2), and events
whose hook lost the merge, which it re-emits (§8).

## 2. Shape of the solution

One JVM, one transforming class loader, one lifecycle, one registry freeze. No genuine loader lifecycle ever
boots: there is no Knot, no ModLauncher, no FancyModLoader discovery, no module layer.

```

     ▼
ForbricClassLoader  (GAME side — the only loader that defines game/ecosystem classes)
 owned jars, in this order (KernelOwnedClasspath.compose):
   1. patched-mc-merged-26.2.jar           --gameJar
   2. forge-runtime-interop.jar,            --runtimeJar   (the two carriers)
      neoforge-runtime.jar
   3. Minecraft's own libraries             --libraryPath  (owned: mods mixin into DataFixerUpper & co.)
   4. kernel-bundled: mixinextras-fabric.jar, forbric-kernel-runtime.jar   (extracted to .forbric-kernel/lib/)
   5. guest mod jars: Forge-family, then Fabric, nested jars included; newest version first within one mod id
```

### 2.1 Boot side vs game side

`forbric-kernel.jar` is parent-loaded and names no game type. Everything that references `net.minecraft.*`,
`net.minecraftforge.*`, `net.neoforged.*` or `net.fabricmc.fabric.*` lives in `src/runtime/java`
(package `net.forbric.kernel.runtime` and its `soak`/`transfer` subpackages, 130 files), is compiled `compileOnly` against the staged game artifacts,
packaged as `forbric-kernel-runtime.jar`, nested at `META-INF/jars/` inside the boot jar, extracted at launch by
`KernelBundledJars` and loaded as an owned jar.

The boot side reaches the game side by *string* (`Class.forName`, `getMethod`, ASM owner names).
`KernelRuntimeClasses` is the registry of every such string, and `KernelRuntimeClasses.verify(loader)` loads the
whole seam through the finished pipeline at boot, so a boot jar built without its game half, or a renamed
game-side method, fails at the top of the log rather than in the middle of a mod's construction.
One game-side class, `net.forbric.kernel.runtime.KernelHudLayer`, is still emitted at runtime with an ASM
`ClassWriter` (by `KernelHudBridge`); everything else on the game side is compiled.

### 2.2 `ForbricClassLoader` and the delegation table

`classloading.ForbricClassLoader` is a flat, JPMS-free `URLClassLoader`. `loadClass` consults
`DelegationPolicy`, in order:

- **ALWAYS_PARENT** — the JDK, ASM (`org.objectweb.asm.`), Mixin (`org.spongepowered.asm.`), log4j/slf4j,
  NightConfig (a carrier bundles an old unshaded copy that would otherwise win child-first),
  `net.fabricmc.api.`, `net.fabricmc.loader.api.`, the Fabric Loader internals in `FabricLoaderInternals` (by exact
  name), `net.forbric.api.`, and the kernel's boot packages (`boot`, `classloading`, `transform`, `mixin`, `access`,
  `mapping`, `metadata`, `discovery`, `fabric`, `util`, `interop`). Exactly one copy per JVM.
- **ALWAYS_GAME** — `net.minecraft.`, `com.mojang.blaze3d.`, `net.minecraftforge.`, `net.neoforged.`,
  `net.fabricmc.fabric.`, `net.forbric.kernel.runtime.`, `com.llamalad7.mixinextras.` and Mixin's synthetic
  package. Defined here or not at all.
- **otherwise child-first**: defined here if an owned jar has it, else the parent.

`tryDefineGameClass` reads the bytes, runs the pre-Mixin chain (`setTransformer`), then the Mixin stage
(`setMixinTransformer`), then `defineClass` with a real `ProtectionDomain` (the jar as code source — mods such as
JourneyMap and spark locate their own jar through it). Other duties of the loader:

- **Pre-Mixin bytes.** `getPreMixinClassBytes` serves Mixin the post-chain, pre-weave bytes; serving woven bytes
  would make the weaver re-weave its output.
- **Generated classes.** `putGeneratedClass` holds classes synthesized by transformers (class-tweaker enum
  extensions); a `null` read with no generated entry is Mixin's cue to synthesize its own.
- **Rescue jars.** `setRescueJars` — the jars cross-jar arbitration superseded — are consulted *only* when no
  owned jar has the class, so they cannot shadow the winner (§4.3).
- **Jar families.** `setJarFamilies` records which ecosystem each mod jar was arbitrated to; `familyOfClass` /
  `familyOfResource` feed the environment stripper and the loader-probe rewriter.
- **Re-entrant definition.** A guest config plugin constructed during Mixin's first `select()` can load the class
  currently being defined; `define` recovers the already-completed definition instead of failing with a
  duplicate-definition `LinkageError`.
- **Package manifests.** Packages are defined with the owning jar's manifest attributes, because genuine FML reads
  `Package.getImplementationVersion()`.

### 2.3 The three game artifacts

None of them is in the repository or in any Forbric download: each embeds Mojang, MinecraftForge or NeoForge
code. They are built on the machine that runs them — by the installer for players (§13), by
`forbric-loader/run/` scripts for developers (§14).

| Artifact | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `patched-mc-merged-26.2.jar` | vanilla 26.2 + MinecraftForge-patched 26.2 + NeoForge-patched 26.2, byte-merged by `net.forbric.tools.MergedBaseBuilder`. NeoForge's classes are the base and Forge's are spliced in; the committed report `forbric-loader/run/merged-base/merge-conflicts.txt` reads `forge=193 neo=10163 MERGED=612` classes and `CONFLICTS: methods=1000 fields=8 STRUCTURAL(superclass/field)=15` |
| `neoforge-runtime.jar` | NeoForge's `-universal` jar plus the libraries its userdev config declares, merged into one jar (`NeoForgeRuntimeBuilder`) |
| `forge-runtime-interop.jar` | MinecraftForge's `-universal` jar plus its runtime libraries (`ForgeRuntimeBuilder`), then patched by `net.forbric.tools.RuntimeInteropPatcher` for interfaces the merge widened on NeoForge's behalf that Forge's own compiled implementations no longer satisfy. Staged under the coordinate `net.forbric:forge-runtime` |

The carriers are *passive*: their classes are defined and their event buses used, but their loaders'
discovery, sorting and lifecycle never run. The kernel supplies only the identity their code queries
(`PassiveSeeder`, §3.2).

## 3. Boot order

### 3.1 Entry

`boot.KernelClientLaunch.main` and `boot.KernelServerLaunch.main` are one line each:

```java
int code = CompatibilityLaunchBoundary.run(() -> KernelBoot.launch(KernelBoot.Side.CLIENT, args));
if (code != 0) System.exit(code);
```

`CompatibilityLaunchBoundary` is the only place a compatibility refusal becomes a process exit (code `78`,
§12.4), and the only place a refused install does (code `2`, §3.2 step 0). Any other throwable leaving the boot is
logged there — message and trace, into `latest.log` — before it is rethrown, because a launcher shows that file and
not stderr. `KernelBoot.launch` consumes `--gameJar`, `--runtimeJar` (repeatable, and one value may carry several jars
joined by the path separator — launchers such as PCL2 keep only the last occurrence of a repeated flag) and
`--libraryPath`; everything else, and everything after `--`, is forwarded to the game's `Main.main`. The dedicated
server rejects `--gameDir`, so `KernelBoot` strips it on that side. The game version is read from the base jar's
`version.json` (fallback `26.2`).

### 3.2 `KernelBoot.launch`, in order

0. **Launch inputs** — `LaunchInputCheck.require(gameJars, runtimeJars)`, by content and before anything is read
   out of them: the base's `Block` must implement an extension interface from both Forge families (the merged base),
   every `--runtimeJar` must carry one family completely (loader SPI, `ModContainer`, `FMLLoader`, `FMLEnvironment`,
   its own `mods.toml`; a jar with only the `mods.toml` is reported as one of that family's mods), and both families
   must be carried by something the launch owns. A failure logs each problem and the fix (rerun the installer with
   *Built artifacts* empty) and stops with exit code `2`; `-Dforbric.launchInputCheck=off` only warns. Issue #13:
   empty "runtime" jars used to pass every later step with an empty answer and die in `KernelRuntimeClasses.verify`
   on stderr, leaving five INFO lines in `latest.log`. The check reads names, not every class; the class javadoc lists
   what it leaves to later steps.
1. **Cross-jar arbitration pre-scan** — `DuplicateModArbiter.arbitrate(mods/, envType)` inventories every root and
   nested candidate and fixes one selection before either ecosystem's discovery runs (§4.3).
2. **Carrier versions** — `EcosystemVersions.record(runtimeJars)`, so a mod whose `versionRange` the carriers
   cannot satisfy is reported as it is discovered.
3. **Forge-family discovery** — every `mods/*.jar` with a Forge-family manifest, then the JarJar children
   (`META-INF/jarjar/`) the arbitration plan selected, taken from the plan's content-addressed extraction under
   `.forbric-kernel/candidates/` (the legacy extractor, writing `.forbric-kernel/jarjar/`, runs only when
   arbitration is off).
4. **Presence** — `ModPresence.publishForgeFamily(…)` before the Fabric side is built, because the Fabric side
   reads it back.
5. **Fabric discovery** — `KernelFabricEcosystem.scan`, then a second arbitration pass over the union of nested
   jars (`DuplicateModArbiter.arbitrateNested`); losers are dropped from both lists.
6. **Mixin config declarations** — Forge-family configs from mod jars, nested mod jars *and the carriers*
   (NeoForge's own `neoforge.mixins.json`).
7. **Fabric ecosystem build** — `KernelFabricEcosystem.build` creates the `FabricLoader` view (§5.1).
8. **Owned classpath** — `KernelOwnedClasspath.compose` (order in §2).
9. **Static audits** over every guest jar, before anything is loaded: `PortingLayerAudit` (Fabric jars shipping
   their own `net.neoforged.*`/`net.minecraftforge.*`), `FabricApiModuleLossAudit`, `FieldDriftAudit`,
   `MergedBaseUncalledMethods.scanGuests`, `AbiLinkAudit` (Forge-family classes named by a jar that exist in no
   carrier, base or installed jar).
10. **Class loader** — `new ForbricClassLoader(owned, bootLoader)`, rescue jars, jar families,
    `LoaderProbePolicy.bindGuestLoader`, `KernelFabricLauncher.install` (a mod's `addToClassPath` lands here).
11. **Transform chain** — 91 `chain.register(…)` call sites (§6).
12. `loader.setTransformer((name, bytes) -> chain.applyBeforeMixin(name, bytes, ctx))`; the context class loader
    becomes the game loader;
    `KernelLifecycle`, `KernelHudBridge`, `LootTableEventDispatch` are bound; `KernelLoadReport` and
    `CrashAttribution` get the run directory (and their shutdown hooks).
13. **Loader identity, before Mixin** — `PassiveSeeder.seedNeoForgePaths`, `seedNeoForgeLoader`,
    `seedForgeFmlLoader`, `publishForgeLoadingList`. This must precede the first class that passes through the
    Mixin transformer, because Mixin constructs every guest `IMixinConfigPlugin` then, and plugins read
    `FMLPaths`/`FMLLoader` in their `<clinit>`. MinecraftForge's `FMLEnvironment` caches `dist` into
    `static final` fields in a one-shot `<clinit>`; whoever touches it first decides it forever.
14. **Mixin** — Fabric configs first, Forge-family configs appended (§7.1); `MixinConfigOwners.publish` before
    registration; `KernelMixinBootstrap.init`.
15. `PassiveSeeder.reportDependencies()` — after Mixin, because half of what it reports (mixins meant for another
    mod that did not attach) is recorded while Mixin parses configs.
16. `KernelRuntimeClasses.verify(loader)` — the kernel's own game side, through the finished pipeline.
17. `PassiveSeeder.seedAll` — NeoForge `FMLLoader`, `ModList`, paths; MinecraftForge identity (idempotent).
18. Audit reports (among them `MixinOverlapLint`, §7.6), `KernelLoadReport.writeEvidence()`, then
    `CompatibilityDecision.requireContinuation(isClient)` — the pre-game decision point (§12.4).
19. `KernelFabricEcosystem.runPreLaunch()` — Fabric `preLaunch` entrypoints, after Mixin, before any game class.
20. Load the entry class (`net.minecraft.server.dedicated.DedicatedServer` / `…client.gui.screens.TitleScreen`
    is the census landmark; the invoked class is the game's `Main`). If `LifecycleHookInjector` did not find its
    trigger, **the kernel refuses to boot** (`missedRequiredExcision()`).
21. `Main.main(gameArgs)` — vanilla boot, with the genuine loader trigger redirected.

### 3.3 The redirected trigger

NeoForge won the merge of both entry points. `transform.LifecycleHookInjector` retargets (owner + name, same
descriptor) one `invokestatic` in each:

| Side | Genuine call in the merged base | Now calls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| server | `net.neoforged.neoforge.server.loading.ServerModLoader.load(Z)V` in `net.minecraft.server.Main.main`, after `Bootstrap.bootStrap()` | `KernelLifecycle.onServerModLoading(boolean)`, followed by Fabric's `Hooks.startServer(null, null)` marker (`-Dforbric.fabricHooks=off` omits it) |
| client | `net.neoforged.neoforge.client.loading.ClientModLoader.begin()V` in `net.minecraft.client.main.Main.main`, after `Bootstrap.validate()`, before `new Minecraft` | `KernelLifecycle.onClientModLoading()` |

The client's later calls into both families' `ClientModLoader` (`finish`, `completeModLoading`) are stubbed by
`MethodBodyNeuter`; `setupModResourcePacks` is redirected to `KernelLifecycle.onClientResourcePacks` instead
(§9.2).

On the client the same injector also makes `Main.logEarlyException` call `KernelLifecycle.onEarlyStartupFailure`
first. That is vanilla's handler for the first three steps of `Main.main` (detecting the version, building and
running the argument parser): it prints to stderr and `main` exits (249, 252, 251) without throwing, so without the
hook the error that ended the game never reached `latest.log`.

### 3.4 The native registration window — `KernelLifecycle.driveNativeRegistration`

Both sides run the same steps (comments in the source number them):

- **0** seed MinecraftForge's `LoadingModList`; wire Forge's `LogicalSidedProvider` executors; on the client, load
  each carrier's built-in translations (`CarrierLanguages`).
- **1** register NeoForge's baseline registries (`PassiveSeeder.seedNeoForgeRegistries`); apply NeoForge's own
  registry modifications (sync flags, callbacks).
- **2** `registerNeoForgeContent` — the window itself:
  1. construct `NeoForgeMod` on a kernel-made bus and container (`KernelModContainerFactory`);
  2. construct every Forge-family `@Mod` (`KernelModLoader.constructMods`, §5.2/5.3);
  3. register guest `@EventBusSubscriber` classes (`KernelEventSubscribers.registerAll`);
  4. post `FMLConstructModEvent` to both families; inject MinecraftForge capabilities;
  5. NeoForge `GameData.vanillaSnapshot`, then **unfreeze**; post `NewRegistryEvent`;
  6. fire `RegisterEvent` per registry on every bus, in NeoForge's registration order; then the MinecraftForge
     baseline (`KernelForgeBaseline.register`);
  7. open `minecraft:root` and run Fabric `main` entrypoints (on the client only when
     `-Dforbric.fabricMainInConstructor=off`; see §3.5);
  8. attribute events, spawn placements, `BlockEntityTypeAddBlocksEvent`, modded game-rule categories, NeoForge's
     tooltip appenders;
  9. `closeRegistrationWindow` (in a `finally`): link block→item, **freeze**, rebuild NeoForge's blockstate→id map,
     re-sort NeoForge's creative tabs.
- **2a–2c3** verify the REGISTRATION bridges; publish the NeoForge baseline in `ModList`; load STARTUP/COMMON
  (and on the client CLIENT) configs; wire both carriers' own `@EventBusSubscriber` classes; install the client
  reload-listener bridge.
- **3a** declare datapack registries (`DataPackRegistryEvent.NewRegistry`, Fabric dynamic registries mirrored both
  ways) — deferred on the client until after the Fabric entrypoints (`DatapackRegistryDeclaration`).
- **3a2** start the game buses (`startGameBuses`) — before the setup phases, because `IEventBus.post` on a bus
  that has not started returns silently.
- **3b** (server) post the setup lifecycle to both families' guest mods (`fireModSetupLifecycle`): common setup,
  dedicated-server setup, NeoForge's `RegistrationEvents.init()` one step at a time (`RegistrationEventSteps` —
  it posts `RegisterCapabilitiesEvent` and `RegisterDataMapTypesEvent`), IMC enqueue/process, load complete; deferred
  work runs between phases on the thread each family uses (`NeoDeferredWork`; failures read back by
  `DeferredWorkFailures`). Then `load-report.txt` is written and `CompatibilityDecision.requireContinuation` is asked
  again — the end-of-loading decision point. On the client every one of these phases, common setup included, is
  deferred to `onNeoClientSetup` (§3.5), because `Minecraft.getInstance()` is still null here.
- **3b2** open configs registered late (from construction or setup).
- **3c** (server) close NeoForge's payload registration phase (`setupNeoForgeNetwork`). It must come after setup:
  mods register payloads from `FMLCommonSetupEvent`.

There is one registration window and one freeze. The "Tags not bound" wall the weld hit (two ecosystems
refreezing in turn) cannot arise.

### 3.5 Client-only hooks inside `Minecraft.<init>`

Fabric and NeoForge need opposite states in the constructor, so the kernel has two anchors:

- `ClientEntrypointHookInjector` → `KernelLifecycle.onClientEntrypoints()`, before `Options` exists: reopen the
  registries (and MinecraftForge's registry gates), construct MinecraftForge mods that were held back because they
  reached for `Minecraft` too early, run Fabric `main` then `client` entrypoints (Fabric's `Hooks.startClient`
  order), re-close and re-freeze, open late CLIENT configs, then declare datapack registries.
- `NeoClientSetupHookInjector` at the merged base's `ClientModLoader.finish()` call →
  `KernelLifecycle.onNeoClientSetup()`, after `options` is assigned: verify the CLIENT_INIT bridges, preload the
  client resource manager (MinecraftForge runs mod loading inside the first reload, and its mods expect their
  assets readable at client setup; `-Dforbric.clientResourcePreload=off`), then `fireClientSetupLifecycle`: common
  setup, client setup, `RegistrationEvents.init()`, IMC, load complete — with the registries frozen, as on genuine
  NeoForge — then `load-report.txt` and the end-of-loading decision (`requireClientContinuation`), then late
  configs, then close the payload registration phase.

## 4. Discovery and arbitration

### 4.1 Reading manifests

- `discovery.ForbricModDiscoverer` classifies a jar by descriptor — `fabric.mod.json`, `META-INF/mods.toml`,
  `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml` — and reports *every* manifest a jar carries. Which one loads is policy (§4.2).
- `metadata.forge.ModsTomlParser` (clean-room; NightConfig for TOML lexing) with `ForgeModsToml`,
  `ForgeModEntry`, `ForgeDependency`; `ForgeVersionRangeTranslator` turns Maven ranges into Fabric-style
  predicates, so `net.forbric.api.UnifiedDependency` has one dialect (`VersionPredicate` evaluates it).
  `UnifiedDependency` also keeps the two axes Fabric has no word for: ordering (`BEFORE`/`AFTER`) and side scope.
- `fabric.FabricModMetadataParser` is the full `fabric.mod.json` v1 reader (entrypoints incl. adapter form, `jars`,
  per-side `mixins`, `accessWidener`, `custom`). `fabric.FabricModDiscovery` follows Fabric JiJ (its extraction
  cache is `.forbric-kernel/jij/`); mods whose `environment` excludes the side are skipped, as on Fabric.
- `discovery.ModAnnotationScanner` finds `@Mod` classes by bytecode descriptor; `ModFileScanner` builds a full
  `ModFileScanData` (NeoForge and MinecraftForge shapes differ: `EnumHolder` vs `EnumData`) because JEI, Jade,
  Sophisticated Core and Sodium find their plugins through `ModList.getAllScanData()`.
- `net.forbric.api.DiscoveredMod` is the one mod model.

The `--scan` mode (`boot.Main --scan --mods <dir> --report out.json`) runs discovery alone and writes
deterministic JSON; `run/diff-oracle.sh` cross-checks it against an independent Python reader of the same
manifests.

### 4.2 One jar, several manifests — `MultiLoaderArbiter`

A universal jar ships a manifest and glue class per loader. Unarbitrated, all three ecosystems initialise it.
`MultiLoaderArbiter.ownerOf(jar)` picks one by preference — default **NeoForge, MinecraftForge, Fabric**
(`-Dforbric.multiLoaderPreference=…`). Forge families first because their baselines are always present on the
merged base; NeoForge before MinecraftForge because NeoForge won most of the merge. A jar that carries a leftover
manifest without its implementation is not given to that loader. The jar stays on the classpath; only its
identity is decided.

### 4.3 Two jars, one mod id — `DuplicateModArbiter`

Merging a Fabric pack with a NeoForge pack puts two *files* under one id. The loser must come **off** the
classpath (first-URL-wins would otherwise let it shadow the winner and contribute its mixin configs).

- **Inventory** — `NestedCandidateInventory` walks every root and nested jar (depth ≤ 8, zip-bomb byte caps, no
  archive-count cap) into a graph of candidates and parent→child edges; nested jars are extracted, keyed by
  SHA-256, under `.forbric-kernel/candidates/`.
- **Selection** — `ReachableCandidateSelector` builds a whole-instance Boolean model (nested candidates exist only
  through selected parents) and solves it with SAT4J; `JointCandidateSelector` supplies the clauses: hard/soft
  dependencies, `breaks`/`incompatible` exclusions, and symbol contracts from `CandidateContractScanner` (only
  evidence strong enough to constrain selection — e.g. a mixin's required members). The search is bounded by
  work, never by a clock (`CONFLICT_BUDGET`, `VARIABLE_LIMIT`, `-Dforbric.arbitrationMaxNodes`, default 100 000),
  so the same folder selects the same jars on any machine.
- **Preferences** — top-level duplicates: `-Dforbric.dupeIdPreference`, falling back to `multiLoaderPreference`.
  Nested duplicates: `-Dforbric.nestedDupePreference`, default NeoForge, Fabric, MinecraftForge — chosen because a
  multi-loader library's per-loader builds stub out phases their loader lacks, and that order leaves the fewest
  callers talking to an empty method (the javadoc records the two cases that fixed it).
- **Overrides** — `-Dforbric.modOwner=sodium=fabric,…` or `<rundir>/forbric-mods.txt` (`<mod id> = <loader>`, one
  per line; the kernel writes a commented template the first time an instance has duplicates). The command line
  wins over the file.
- **Switched off** — `<rundir>/forbric-disabled.txt` lists jar file names in `mods/` (comments and bad lines as in
  `forbric-mods.txt`). `DisabledMods` keeps those jars out of the scan, so they never become claims, and they go
  into `Decision.suppressedJars` but never `rescueJars`; with `-Dforbric.crossJarArbitration=off` a decision
  holding only them is still cached. `load-report.txt` names them.
- **Residuals** — the losing ecosystem gets a presence-only alias so `isLoaded(id)` still answers
  (`Decision.aliases`); the other ecosystem's build of a mod that did load may lend a missing class as a last
  resort (`rescueJars`); `ArbitratedAwayClasses` measures what the losing build had that the winner lacks.
  `MergeReport` writes `.forbric-kernel/merge-report.txt` explaining each decision.
- `-Dforbric.crossJarArbitration=off` disables it entirely.

### 4.4 Answering "which loader am I on?" and "is X installed?"

- `LoaderProbePolicy` + `transform.LoaderProbeRewriter` (COREMOD phase) rewrite `Class.forName` call sites in a
  single-loader guest class so a platform probe (`FMLLoader`, `FabricLoader`) answers for the ecosystem that jar
  was arbitrated to (`-Dforbric.loaderProbes=off`).
- `net.forbric.api.ModPresence` is the cross-ecosystem answer. `transform.ForeignModPresenceInjector` ORs it into
  both families' `ModList.isLoaded`; the Fabric side registers every Forge-family mod as a presence-only container
  (identity only — no entrypoints, mixins or assets), so `FabricLoader.isModLoaded` answers; and the Forge-family
  lists are seeded with the Fabric mods (`-Dforbric.crossEcosystemPresence=off` restores single-loader answers).
  `net.forbric.api.ModIds` maps ids the ecosystems spell differently (`cloth-config` / `cloth_config`).
- `ModConstructionOrder` orders Forge-family construction topologically — a mod after everything it requires or
  declares `AFTER`; ties alphabetical; cycles named, not broken silently (`-Dforbric.modOrder=name` restores
  file-name order). Fabric mods initialise in Fabric Loader's own order, by mod id (`FabricLoadOrder`;
  `-Dforbric.fabricOrder=off` puts them back on the topological order).

## 5. The three ecosystems, driven by the kernel

### 5.1 Fabric — no Fabric Loader code runs

- `fabric.KernelFabricLoader` *is* the `FabricLoader` singleton: a view over kernel state, with its entrypoint
  index frozen before mod code runs. `KernelModContainer` exposes each jar through a zip `FileSystem`;
  `KernelLanguageAdapters` honours `languageAdapters` (fabric-language-kotlin); `KernelObjectShare`,
  `KernelVersion`, `KernelMappingResolver` (identity) complete the API.
- The mod-facing API is vendored under its own names: `src/main/java/net/fabricmc/api` (7 files) and
  `src/main/java/net/fabricmc/loader` (30 files: `loader.api.*` plus the narrow internals mods actually link against
  — `FabricLoaderImpl`, `ModContainerImpl`, `EntrypointStorage`, `Hooks`, `FabricLauncher`/`FabricLauncherBase`,
  `DefaultLanguageAdapter`, `StringUtil`, legacy `net.fabricmc.loader.FabricLoader`). `FabricLoaderInternals`
  pins those internals to the parent by exact name; `-Dforbric.fabricImpl=off` withholds them. The API level
  reported is `KernelFabricEcosystem.FABRIC_LOADER_API_LEVEL = "0.19.3"`.
- Entrypoints: `preLaunch` after Mixin (§3.2 step 19); `main` inside the registration window (server) or in
  `Minecraft.<init>` (client, default); `client` in `Minecraft.<init>`; `server` on the dedicated server. Each
  mod's entrypoint is invoked in isolation — one throwing mod is recorded and skipped — with a NeoForge
  `ModContainer` for that mod active (`KernelForeignShimContext`), because a Fabric mod may hold the NeoForge build
  of a multi-loader library.
- Fabric access wideners / class tweakers run in the `ACCESS` phase (`access.ClassTweakerTransformer`);
  `@Environment` stripping in `ENV_STRIP` (`EnvironmentStripTransformer`, only for classes from jars arbitrated to
  Fabric).

### 5.2 NeoForge

- **Identity** — `PassiveSeeder` creates a current `FMLLoader`, `FMLPaths`, a `LoadingModList` and `ModList` built
  from the jars this boot selected — no discovery, no module layer, no sorting.
- **Construction** — `KernelModLoader`: a `BusBuilder` `IEventBus` plus a kernel `ModContainer`
  (`net.forbric.kernel.runtime.KernelModContainer`); constructor arguments filled by type (`IEventBus`, `Dist`,
  `ModContainer`).
- **Buses** — mod-bus events the kernel posts itself go through `KernelLifecycle.postModBusEvent`; setup phases
  through `runtime.KernelNeoSetup`; deferred work runs on the thread NeoForge runs it on (`NeoDeferredWork`).
- **Enum extensions** — `NeoEnumExtensions` feeds every jar's `META-INF/enumextensions.json` to NeoForge's own
  `RuntimeEnumExtender`; `NeoEnumExtensionInjector` is registered near the end of COREMOD (its placement is
  load-bearing: it defines FML classes at that point), and only if some mod declares an extension.
- **Coremods** — NeoForge's coremod jar is never loaded; `transform.NativeCoremodParity` performs its rewrites
  (flower pot `potted`, biome climate/effects, structure settings, `finalizeSpawn`) *after* Mixin, where NeoForge
  runs them.

### 5.3 MinecraftForge

- **Identity** — `PassiveSeeder.seedForgeFmlLoader` (pre-Mixin, §3.2); `ForgeLoadingListHolderInjector` makes
  `LoadingModListImpl$1LazyInit` read the kernel's published list (`net.forbric.api.ForgeLoadingList`) instead of a
  field only the genuine loader fills; `ForgeLauncherInfoInjector` answers `FMLLoader`'s three ModLauncher-backed
  methods; `ForgeBindingsLookupInjector` resolves `Bindings` without FML's module layer; `ForgeSecureJarStandIn`
  gives seeded `ModFile`s a `SecureJar` without ModLauncher.
- **Construction** — `KernelForgeModContext` manufactures the EventBus 7 `BusGroup` + `FMLModContainer` +
  `FMLJavaModLoadingContext` triple every Forge mod constructor takes. Mods that reach for `Minecraft` in the early
  window are deferred to `onClientEntrypoints`, where MinecraftForge constructs its own.
- **Loading state** — `KernelLifecycle.setForgeLoadingState` flips `loadingStateValid`; `publishForgeGatherStates`
  records `VALIDATE … LOAD_REGISTRIES` as completed so `ModLoader.hasCompletedState` tells the truth
  (`-Dforbric.forgeLoadingStates=off`).
- **Capabilities** — the merge put `Entity`/`BlockEntity`/`Level` under NeoForge's attachment hierarchy, so
  `transform.ForgeCapabilityCompositionTransformer` composes MinecraftForge's `CapabilityProvider` into those root
  types and `ForgeCapabilityTokenInjector` drives Forge's `CapabilityTokenSubclass` plugin
  (`-Dforbric.forgeCapabilities=off`). `CapabilityUseAudit` lists the jars that use MinecraftForge capabilities and
  marks them DEGRADED if the composition is off or did not land on every root type.
- **Enum extensions** — `ForgeEnumExtensionInjector` drives MinecraftForge's own processor (unconditional; it
  declines everything unless Forge's mod list holds more than two mods).
- **Configs** — `KernelForgeConfigLoad` opens genuine MinecraftForge configs one at a time, keeping Forge's reader,
  events, save and file watcher; the watchers are stopped on exit by `interop.ClientShutdown`
  (`ExitHookInjector`: `Minecraft.close` on the client, `DedicatedServer.onServerExit` on the server).

### 5.4 Cross-ecosystem services that are not events

- **Networking** — `interop.PayloadInterop` selects a custom-payload codec by runtime payload class where Fabric
  API and NeoForge share a vanilla channel id; `CommonNetworkInteropInjector` arbitrates the `c:version` /
  `c:register` channel both claim (`-Dforbric.commonNetworkInterop=off`); `RegistrySyncParityInjector` +
  `KernelForgeWrapperSync` apply NeoForge's registry sync to MinecraftForge-wrapped registries through Forge's own
  `GameData.injectSnapshot`; `KernelRegistryRevert` restores pre-connection ids on disconnect;
  `NetworkChannelCensus` compares registered vs declared channels.
- **Item/fluid/energy transfer** — `KernelTransferInterop` + `runtime/transfer/` bridge Fabric's transfer API,
  NeoForge's `ResourceHandler` and MinecraftForge capabilities, and Team Reborn Energy when installed
  (`-Dforbric.transferBridge=off`, `-Dforbric.hopperFabricStorage=off`). Active only when the relevant APIs are
  present, checked by resource.

## 6. The transform pipeline

`transform.TransformPhase` fixes the order: `RAW_PATCH`, `DEOBF_REMAP`, `ENV_STRIP`, `ACCESS`, `COREMOD`,
`FABRIC_BUILTIN`, `MIXIN`. `TransformChain` runs the chain phases (`RAW_PATCH` … `FABRIC_BUILTIN`); within a phase,
`predepends` topologically, then `sortIndex`, then registration order. `MIXIN` is terminal and cannot be registered
into the chain. On 26.2 nothing is registered in `RAW_PATCH` or `DEOBF_REMAP`.

What `KernelBoot` registers (91 call sites; some conditional):

| Phase | Registered |
| --- | --- |
| `ENV_STRIP` | `EnvironmentStripTransformer` |
| `ACCESS` | `ClassTweakerTransformer` (Fabric), `access.AccessTransformer` built from every mod jar's **and both carriers'** `META-INF/accesstransformer*.cfg` — the carriers' ATs matter because where the merge kept the other family's body it kept that body's access (`MenuScreens.register` came out private) |
| `COREMOD` | 86 registrations: the loader-probe rewriter, the Mixin-weaver slot (`FmlContextLoaderRewriter`, `ModuleClassLoaderInitInjector`), `GuestMixinPluginGuard`, the lifecycle redirect, `ForbricMergedBaseCompatTransformer`, the capability composition, and most of the 70 `*Injector` classes in `transform/`, each repairing one named seam the merge broke or landing one bridge (§8) |
| `FABRIC_BUILTIN` | `RestoredAccessTransformer` (re-applies access to members COREMOD restored), `MergedBaseFrameRecomputer` (recomputes a guest class's stack-map frames when they name a superclass the merge removed) |

The post-Mixin stage (`KernelMixinBootstrap`) is a fixed composition:

```
Mixin (via MixinWeaverSlot) → NativeCoremodParity → PostMixinFixups → InterfaceDefaultConflictRepair
                           → ForgeTransferShapeAudit.certify
```

Notable repairs by family (read each class's javadoc for the case that motivated it):

- **Merge invariants** — `ForbricMergedBaseCompatTransformer` (lambda bootstrap handles vs. static-ness, the
  MinecraftForge `getFluidType()` bridge, key-mapping `MAP` initializer, and retargeting the base's baked-in
  calls to `net/forbric/loader/impl/…` onto `net.forbric.kernel.interop`), `DuplicateLambdaPruneInjector`
  (orphaned lambdas a name-only mixin selector would bind to), `WidenedFieldTwinInjector` (vanilla-descriptor
  twins of re-typed fields), `MethodBodyNeuter`.
- **Packs and data** — `DataPackHookInjector`, `ClientPackHookInjector`, `PackMetadataFailSoftInjector`,
  `PackOverlayMutabilityInjector`, `NullPackGuardInjector`, `PackScreenHiddenFilterInjector`,
  `RegistryDirectoryOwnerInjector`, `RegistryAliasParityInjector` (§9).
- **UI** — `ModsButtonRedirector` (both families' pause-menu lambdas open `KernelModListScreen`),
  `HudElementBridgeInjector`, `CreativePagerBridgeInjector`, `EarlyKeyMappingRegistrationInjector`.
- **Instrumentation** — `ClientSmokeTickInjector` (inert unless `-Dforbric.clientSmoke=true`),
  `EventChainAuditInjector` (inert unless `-Dforbric.eventChainAudit=<report>`), `ServerTickSamplerInjector`,
  `CompatibilityPromptTickInjector`, `ServerCompatibilityTickInjector`.
- **Hardening** — `ChunkExecutorGuardInjector` (refuses work offered to a stopped server's chunk executor;
  `-Dforbric.chunkExecutorGuard=off`).

Transformers that promise to land on a class declare it (`AnchorSet`); `AnchorLedger` reports a class that
passed through without being changed (a **Miss**, logged at ERROR immediately) and, at the census landmark,
classes never loaded. `RepairDriftCensus` (`run/compat/repair-drift.sh`) replays the claims against a *candidate*
game build — the question a carrier bump asks.

## 7. Mixin on the merged base

### 7.1 The kernel is the Mixin service

`mixin.ForbricMixinService` is registered through `META-INF/services/org.spongepowered.asm.service.IMixinService`
(with `ForbricMixinServiceBootstrap` and `ForbricGlobalPropertyService`); the Mixin library is Fabric's fork
(`net.fabricmc:sponge-mixin`, `mixin_version` in `gradle.properties`), and MixinExtras is the kernel-bundled
`mixinextras-fabric` (game-side, because its generated `LocalRef` classes must share the game's loader).
`KernelMixinBootstrap.init` binds the service, registers every config, installs `KernelMixinErrorHandler`, installs
the weaver as the last pipeline stage, then moves the environment to `INIT` and `DEFAULT`. Configs are prepared —
and plugins constructed — on the first class through the transformer, which is `KernelRuntimeClasses.verify`.

Order: Fabric configs in Fabric Loader's order, Forge-family configs appended. Mixin orders by priority;
registration order only breaks ties, so the least-proven set becomes the outer wrapper around a known-good stack.
`MixinWeaverSlot` lets a guest replace the weaver the way NeoForge allows (LibJF wraps
`FMLMixinClassProcessor.transformer`).

### 7.2 What happens to a guest config before Mixin reads it

`ForbricMixinService` rewrites each config's JSON:

1. **Whole-config gate** — `MixinConfigPolicy.isDisabled`: the built-in list in `MergedBaseMixinCompat`
   (`-Dforbric.mergedBaseCompat=off` drops it; `-Dforbric.enableMixinConfigs` forces one back),
   plus `-Dforbric.disableMixinConfigs` (csv, trailing `*` glob).
2. **Relaxation** — every config not starting with `forbric` is a guest config and is relaxed:
   `injectors.defaultRequire → 0`, `overwrites.requireAnnotations → false`, `required → false`. Per-injector
   `require`/`expect` still win. `-Dforbric.relaxGuestMixins=off` restores strict behaviour;
   `-Dforbric.relaxMixinOverwrites` relaxes named configs when that is off; `-Dforbric.mixinDiagnostics` keeps
   injection requirements strict (so every misfit is reported) while keeping `required=false`.
3. **Per-mixin drops** — the union of `KernelGuestMixinAdapter.unfitMixins` (below), the hand list
   `MergedBaseMixinCompat.SUPPRESSED_MIXINS`, and `-Dforbric.suppressMixins=config:Mixin,…`, minus
   `-Dforbric.keepMixins`. Dropping a mixin also drops every mixin that depends on an interface it contributed.

### 7.3 `MixinFit` — resolution, not provenance

`KernelGuestMixinAdapter` asks `MixinFit.evaluate` to resolve every anchor a guest mixin names — each `@Shadow`,
each injector's target method, each `@At(target=…)` — against the **post-chain** bytes of the merged target:

| Verdict | Meaning | Default action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FIT` | every anchor resolves | apply |
| `PARTIAL` | some resolve | **apply** (drop only under `-Dforbric.mixinFit=strict`); always reported |
| `UNFIT` | none resolve | drop |
| `HAZARD` | applies cleanly but shadows a field the merge orphaned | drop |

Refinements: pure accessor/invoker mixins are always kept; anchors satisfied by another mod's mixin
(`ForeignMixinTargets`, `MixinAddedMembers`) count as resolved; `@Group` injectors are judged as a group; an
injector bound only to a merged-base method nothing in the merged game calls is **not** resolved (liveness,
`MergedBaseUncalledMethods`, `-Dforbric.mixinFit.liveness=off`) unless an installed mod calls it. `MixinFitReport`
runs the same judgement offline: `MixinFitReport <merged-base.jar> <mods-dir> [--verbose]`.

Provenance was the previous rule and was wrong: the merged base *is* NeoForge's patched Minecraft with Forge
spliced in, so "a Forge-family class" describes most of the jar.

### 7.4 Adapters — moving an injector to where the code went

Rather than drop, the kernel moves a guest injector when the merge relocated what it wants. Each adapter is
narrow and table- or proof-driven:

`MixinRetarget` and `MixinStubRebind` (delegating stubs → the overload carrying the body), `MixinOverloadPin`
(name-only selector with two same-named merged methods), `MixinMergedTwin` (`$forbricneo` renamed anonymous
twins), `MixinAnonymousRetarget` + `MergedBaseAnonymousDrift` (renumbered `Outer$N`), `MixinAtWidenedCall` and
`MixinWrapOperationShim` (calls the carrier widened or reordered), `MixinRelocatedCall`, `MixinSubtypeOwnerRetarget`,
`MixinShearsRelay`, `MixinHandlerShim`, `MixinAtShape` (`at=[…]` vs `at=…` across Mixin forks), `MixinLocalsCapture`
(`CAPTURE_FAILHARD → CAPTURE_FAILSOFT`), `InsertedLambdaArgumentShim`, `MergedBaseCalleeSwaps`,
`MergedBaseAbsorbedCalls`, `CarrierHelpers` (table `carrier-helpers.txt`), and per-surface Fabric adapters
(`FabricBlockBreakMixinAdapter`, `FabricEntityMixinAnchors`, `FabricClientMixinAnchors`,
`FabricEnchantmentMixinAdapter`, `FabricMiningMixinAdapter`, `FabricSoundMixinAdapter`,
`FabricServerLanguageMixinAdapter`). `GuestInjectorPruner` (COREMOD) trims individual injectors from a guest mixin
class where the kernel replaces their function. Several adapters read shipped tables under
`src/main/resources/net/forbric/kernel/mixin/` (`carrier-helpers.txt`, `carrier-stubs.txt`,
`lambda-permutations.txt`, `uncalled-methods.txt`); `CarrierHelperCensusTest` and `UncalledMethodCensusTest`
re-derive the first and last from the staged jars and pin them.

### 7.5 Attribution

`MixinConfigOwners` maps each config to its mod before registration, so Mixin's own failures name the mod (and
`-Dforbric.mixinModIdDecoration` puts the mod id into generated handler names). `KernelMixinErrorHandler` puts
prepare/apply failures on the mod's row without changing Mixin's decision. `FinalMixinApplications` observes each
defined class after all stages — zero references to a handler prove it did not attach. `SupersededMixins` keeps a
failure off the mod's row when a named kernel repair does *everything* that mixin did; `PluginDeclinedMixins` when
the mod's own config plugin would have declined it; `ForeignMixinBreaks` records mixins written to attach to
another mod that did not. `MixinCompatibility` carries one identity for a mixin from preflight to application.

### 7.6 Cross-mod overlaps — `MixinOverlapLint`

`MixinFit` judges one mixin against the base; two mods that each fit can still collide. `MixinOverlapLint` lists
every handler's claim (target method, `@At` call, ordinal) and pairs claims of different mods — a bundled module
counts as its installed jar, and two jars of one mod id as one mod:

| Rule | Pair | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | two `@Overwrite` of one method — one body survives: the higher priority, or the first at equal priority | conflict |
| R2 | two `@Redirect` of one call, equal or open ordinals — Mixin keeps one | conflict |
| R3 | an `@Overwrite` and another mod's injector in that method | conflict |
| R4 | a `@Redirect` and another mod's `@WrapOperation`/`@ModifyExpressionValue` on one call | note |

A wildcard/regex selector or a bare name on an unreadable target makes no claim; slices are not read. At boot
(§3.2 step 18) it reads each config as `ForbricMixinService` served it to Mixin, after the kernel's drops, and
records one `SUSPECTED` finding per mod and conflict, id `mixin-overlap:<owner>.<name><desc>[@<at>]`, the detail
naming the other mod; it logs counts and elapsed ms (`-Dforbric.mixinOverlapLint=off` skips it). When a crash
stack passes through a method with a recorded conflict, `CrashAttribution` names both mods. Offline:
`MixinOverlapLint <merged-base.jar> <mods-dir> [--json out]` (jars found recursively).

## 8. Event bridges

On the merged base the two Forge families' hooks competed for the same call sites and one won; the loser's hook
is dead code, so that family's listeners sit on a bus nobody posts to. A MinecraftForge mod needs an instance of
exactly `net.minecraftforge.…Event`, so re-emission is intrinsic.

- **Inventory** — `net.forbric.api.GameEventBridge` enumerates 96 bridges, each with the event, its install pass
  and its **cost** in player terms. Passes: `GAME_BUS` (both sides), `CLIENT_GAME_BUS`, `CLIENT_MOD_BUS`,
  `CLIENT_INIT`, `REGISTRATION`, `CLIENT_HUD`, `ON_DEMAND`.
- **Verification** — `net.forbric.api.EventBridges.verify(pass)` compares achieved against declared and names what
  is missing with its cost; a bridge that fails to install costs a feature and throws nothing, so this is the only
  way it becomes visible.
- **Implementation** — `boot.GameEventMultiplexer` installs the bus bridges; the game-side halves are
  `runtime.KernelGame*Events` (tick, server lifecycle, player, level, world, block, entity, damage, tracking,
  client tick/render/input/network/resource/screen-mouse events) and `KernelGameResultBridges` for the two whose
  MinecraftForge side returns a value. Cancellable events forward the cancellation back. Transformers land the
  bridges that are not bus-to-bus (`ForgeDamageSeamsInjector`, `ForgeCreativeTabsInjector`,
  `ForgeSpawnPlacementsInjector`, `ForgeClientConsumersInjector`, `ForgeBlockTintInjector`,
  `ForgeOverlayNeuterInjector`/`KernelForgeOverlayLayers`, …).
- **The other directions** — NeoForge events the merged body no longer posts (`ItemTooltipEvent` via
  `KernelItemTooltips`, `ScreenEvent.Opening/Closing` via `NeoScreenEventsInjector`, conversion `Post` via
  `NeoConversionPostInjector`); Fabric API events fired from NeoForge's own sites where Fabric's mixin cannot fit
  (`LootTableEventBridgeInjector` + `LootTableEventDispatch` for `LootTableEvents`, `KernelHudBridge` for
  `HudElementRegistry`, `FabricFuelValuesInjector`, tooltip and block-break adapters).
- **Audits** — `HookCallSiteCensus` (which hooks of `ForgeEventFactory`/`ForgeEventFactoryClient`/NeoForge
  `ClientHooks` the merged base still calls), `DeadEventAudit` + `ForgeBusSubscriptions` (who listens to a dead
  event, including subscriptions an annotation scan cannot see), `DeadHookWorklist` (the join, ordered by how many
  installed jars notice), `EventChainAudit` (every cross-bus post, checked by one rule set; gate-m41).

## 9. Datapacks, resources and data

### 9.1 Server data

A genuine loader turns every mod jar into a pack by walking `ModList`'s mod files. The kernel publishes mods into
`ModList` with `modFiles` empty, so that walk finds nothing. `DataPackHookInjector` →
`KernelLifecycle.onServerDataPacks` → `KernelDataPacks` / `runtime.KernelDataPackSource` serve each Forge-family
jar's `data/` — and both carriers' (`c:` convention tags, `neoforge:` damage types and data maps exist only there).
Metadata is read through NeoForge's `ResourcePackLoader.readWithOptionalMeta`, keeping root-pack overlays. Where
the carriers ship the same file, tags are additive and NeoForge wins last-wins files. Fabric mods' data is served
by fabric-api's own resource loader as on Fabric. `KernelPackFinders` lets a MinecraftForge mod add its own pack
finder (`-Dforbric.modDataPacks=off` disables the Forge-family packs).

### 9.2 Client assets

NeoForge's `mod_resources` source is orphaned on the merged base. `ClientPackHookInjector` redirects the body of
`ClientModLoader.setupModResourcePacks(PackRepository)` to `KernelLifecycle.onClientResourcePacks`, where
`KernelClientPacks` adds one pack per ecosystem jar (compatibility forced to `COMPATIBLE`, as both genuine loaders
do) before the first reload. `PackScreenHiddenFilterInjector` keeps those packs out of the resource-pack screen.
The kernel's own assets (the Mods button icon) ride in `forbric-kernel-runtime.jar`.

### 9.3 Pack metadata written for three loaders at once

A multiloader `pack.mcmeta` carries a section per loader, and on Forbric all three parsers read it.
`KernelPackMetadata` + `PackMetadataFailSoftInjector` keep an unparsable foreign section from dropping the whole
pack; `PackOverlayMutabilityInjector` (repair) and `NullPackGuardInjector` (backstop) handle NeoForge's overlay
merge mutating a list fabric-api has frozen (`KernelPackRepair` documents both).

### 9.4 Conditions, registries, data maps, worldgen

- **Resource conditions** — three evaluators, because the merged `RegistryLoadTask` carries both families' patches:
  `runtime.KernelFabricConditions` (`fabric:load_conditions`; fabric-api's own two mixins cannot fit),
  `KernelNeoConditions`, `KernelForgeConditions` — each keeps one dialect from failing another's files.
- **Registry directories** — `RegistryDirectoryOwnerInjector` / `KernelRegistryDirectories`: `registryDirPath`
  answers as the owning ecosystem does. **Aliases** — `RegistryAliasParityInjector` / `KernelRegistryAliases`.
- **Datapack registries** — `KernelLifecycle.registerDataPackRegistries` posts `DataPackRegistryEvent.NewRegistry`,
  declares MinecraftForge's biome/structure modifier registries and mirrors Fabric dynamic registries both ways.
- **Data maps** — NeoForge data maps are loaded (`KernelNeoDataMapWatch`, `KernelNeoWorldgen`).
- **Worldgen** — MinecraftForge biome/structure modifiers ride inside NeoForge's single modifier pass
  (`runtime.KernelForgeWorldgen`; `-Dforbric.forgeWorldgen=off`, with `ForgeWorldgenShippers` naming the mods
  that then lose it). `NativeCoremodParity`, `BiomeInfoRebaseInjector`, `BiomeLateWriteInjector` make the modified
  views read. gate-m31 holds zero-mod worldgen to vanilla's biomes and structure starts at the same seed.

## 10. The unified API — `net.forbric.api`

Parent-pinned (one copy per JVM), and what the kernel and all three compatibility layers speak instead of
translating pairwise:

| Type | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Ecosystem`, `Side` | the one ecosystem and side vocabulary |
| `ForeignType` | 58 rows mapping one Forge-family concept to its MinecraftForge and NeoForge class names — names only; per-family divergence stays data |
| `DiscoveredMod`, `UnifiedDependency`, `VersionPredicate`, `ModIds` | the mod and dependency model |
| `ModPresence`, `ModCatalog` | "is X running", and the list a player sees with status `OK` / `DEGRADED` / `FAILED` |
| `GameEventBridge`, `EventBridges` | the bridge inventory and its verification |
| `ForgeLoadingList` | what MinecraftForge's `LoadingModList` is built from |
| `CompatibilityFinding`, `CompatibilityFindings` | per-launch evidence ledger (§12) |

It is not a stable API for mods.

## 11. The Mods screen

`runtime.KernelModListScreen` replaces both families' mod list screens (`ModsButtonRedirector`) and reads
`ModCatalog`, which `KernelModCatalog` fills from discovery plus a second read of each jar for description,
authors and logo. Each `ModCatalog.Entry` carries a `status` and a `statusDetail`, and names the mod that bundled
it when it came in nested.
`KernelModConfigScreens` reaches a mod's own config screen.

## 12. Compatibility reporting and policy

### 12.1 Evidence

`net.forbric.api.CompatibilityFinding(id, modId, feature, source, confidence, required, detail, evidence)`;
`Confidence` is `SUSPECTED`, `CONFIRMED` or `RESOLVED`. Only `CONFIRMED && required` can stop a launch;
`RESOLVED` is kept as evidence and never marks a mod. `CompatibilityFindings` is the per-launch ledger shared by
boot code, the game UI and release checks. Producers include the dependency audit (`DependencyAudit`, across
ecosystems — no single resolver runs over the combined set), arbitration, Mixin preflight/apply, missing bridges,
deferred-work failures, the static audits of §3.2, `KernelTransferInterop`, and late server/client findings.

### 12.2 Files — all under `<gameDir>/.forbric-kernel/`

| File | Written |
| --- | --- |
| `load-report.txt` | at the pre-game boundary as evidence, again after the setup lifecycle, again at `ServerStartedEvent` (the world is up; integrated servers post it too) and when late findings arrive (`-Dforbric.loadReportRewrite=off` keeps the first write); a shutdown hook writes it if loading never finishes. In the system language |
| `compatibility-report.json` | beside it, the machine-readable findings |
| `merge-report.txt` | when two jars claimed one mod id (§4.3) |
| `crash-analysis.txt` | after a crash report: which mods the stack points at, including both mods of a mixin overlap in a method on the stack (`CrashAttribution`, §7.6; `-Dforbric.crashAnalysis=off`). The Forge `Suspected Mods:` line depends on a module layer the kernel does not build |
| `crash-suspects.json` | beside it: `{schema:1, report, clash, suspects:[{modId,name,jar,reason,depth}]}`. On the next client launch, before arbitration, `CrashSuspectOffer` offers to start without those jars (for a clash, every side but the first-named), appends them to `<gameDir>/forbric-disabled.txt` on "Start without", and renames the file `crash-suspects.offered.json` whatever the answer. A server, a headless run and `-Dforbric.dependencyDialog=off` only log the lines |

Working directories in the same place: `lib/` (extracted bundled jars), `jij/`, `jarjar/`, `candidates/`.

### 12.3 Dependency dialog

`ui.DependencyDialog` shows unmet hard dependencies and cross-mod mixin breaks to the player. The window is a
**separate JVM** (`DependencyDialogMain`, launched with the kernel jar as its only classpath entry) because on macOS
the game runs with `-XstartOnFirstThread` and AWT cannot share thread one with GLFW. Parent and child share only
the tab-separated file format in `DependencyReport`; strings are in `DialogLang` (system language,
`-Dforbric.dialogLanguage=<code>` forces one). `-Dforbric.dependencyDialog=on` (default) | `off` | `dryRun` (forks
the real child with AWT disabled — what gates assert on). The child times out after 10 minutes. The same child
has a third window, `--isolation`: the crash-suspects offer of §12.2, whose exit code `2` means start without them;
anything but its two explicit buttons starts with every mod.

### 12.4 Policy — `-Dforbric.compatibilityPolicy`

`ui.CompatibilityDecision.policy()`:

| Value | A confirmed required loss… |
| --- | --- |
| `ask` (default) | asks the player once in the dialog (the dependency notice folded in); only an explicit Continue approves. No display, or no answer → not approved |
| `continue` | is accepted and recorded; the notice may still be shown |
| `strict` | stops the launch; no window is shown |
| anything else | treated as `strict` (fail closed) |

The decision is asked at the pre-game boundary (§3.2 step 18), again at the end of loading (§3.4 step 3b on the
server, `fireClientSetupLifecycle` on the client), and at `ServerStartedEvent` on a dedicated server (a required
failure during world loading halts the server normally). A refusal throws `CompatibilityDecision.LaunchStopped`;
`CompatibilityLaunchBoundary` turns it into exit code **78** and prints the report path; inside
`Minecraft.<init>` it leaves through `SilentInitException`, so it is not reported as a crash. Findings that appear after boot never fork Swing or exit the JVM: on the server they are
consumed at the completed-tick boundary (`LateServerCompatibility`), on the client on a render-thread tick by a
native Minecraft screen (`KernelCompatibilityPrompts`, `KernelCompatibilityScreen`). An installed profile passes no
JVM arguments, so players get `ask`; `run/launch-kernel-{client,server}.sh` default to `strict` (and the client
script to `-Dforbric.dependencyDialog=off`).

## 13. The installer — `forbric-kernel-installer/`

Pure JDK, no dependencies, bytecode release 17, version `0.3.1-beta2`.

```
java -jar forbric-kernel-installer.jar                     # window (InstallerGui)
java -jar forbric-kernel-installer.jar --dir DIR [options] # headless install
    --mc 26.2  --artifacts DIR  --jdk PATH  --remote  --release TAG  --mirror PREFIX  --offline
java -jar forbric-kernel-installer.jar --doctor [--dir DIR] [--jdk PATH]
```

### 13.1 Building the game artifacts on the player's machine

`ArtifactBuilder.build` runs under `<mcDir>/.forbric-build/`, resuming at the first unfinished step:

```

- `ForgeRuntimeBuilder`, `PatchedMcBuilder` (Forge's `installertools`/`mergetool`/`binarypatcher` as child JVMs,
  Forge's `AccessTransformerEngine` in-process), `NeoForgeRuntimeBuilder`, `NfrtRunner` (NeoFormRuntime, result
  `gameJarNoRecomp` — binary patches, no decompiler, no `javac`).
- `MergedBaseTool` unpacks `forbric-merge-tools.jar` from the installer's resources and runs
  `net.forbric.tools.MergedBaseBuilder` (`-Xmx4g`), `RuntimeInteropPatcher`, then `MergedLinkChecker` against the
  packaged reviewed baseline. **An install fails unless the link check reports `new 0`.**
- `--artifacts DIR` ("Built artifacts (leave empty)" in the window) is for developers only and skips the build.
  `GameArtifacts` takes the three jars from that directory alone and opens each before anything is downloaded or
  written: the merged base must be Minecraft 26.2 whose `net/minecraft/` classes refer to both
  `net/minecraftforge/` and `net/neoforged/`; each runtime must hold its family's core class and its mod loader
  (`FMLLoader`, `IModInfo`), and name the pinned version as its manifest's main `Implementation-Version`
  (`Pins.NEOFORGE`; for MinecraftForge the FML half of `Pins.FORGE`, `65.0.1`); and the MinecraftForge runtime
  must be the interop-patched one, whose `NamespacedWrapper$3` declares `contents()`. Only then the link check,
  which on its own passes any jar that refers to nothing outside itself (issue #13); a supplied set that fails it
  is reported as files that do not fit together, with the same way out.
- `Pins`: `MINECRAFT = "26.2"` (the only supported version), `FORGE = "26.2-65.0.1"`, `NEOFORGE = "26.2.0.88"`,
  `NFRT = "2.0.18"`, `NFRT_RESULT = "gameJarNoRecomp"`, each with its reason in the source. `BuildStamp` keys every
  cached artifact to the pin set, so a pin bump cannot be served from cache.
- `JdkLocator` needs Java ≥ 21 for the build tools (NeoFormRuntime is class-file 65); it tries the running JVM,
  then the launcher's runtimes, then the system, and never downloads a JDK. The game itself needs Java 25.

### 13.2 The profile

`Installer` writes `versions/26.2-forbric/26.2-forbric.json`:

- `inheritsFrom: "26.2"`, `mainClass: net.forbric.kernel.boot.KernelClientLaunch`, no JVM arguments;
- game arguments `--gameJar <merged>`, `--runtimeJar <forge-runtime><sep><neoforge-runtime>` (one flag),
  `--libraryPath <every vanilla library for this platform>`;
- `libraries`: the bundled Forbric jars and the kernel's third-party dependencies (from the kernel's own
  `printBootClasspath`), plus the three game artifacts staged as `net.forbric:patched-mc-merged`,
  `net.forbric:forge-runtime`, `net.forbric:neoforge-runtime`;
- a `forbric` block, metadata only, declaring `net.fabricmc:fabric-loader:0.19.3` so launchers that detect a
  loader by searching the JSON's text treat the instance as modded (and give it its own mods folder).

Mods for all three ecosystems go in `<mcDir>/mods` (or `versions/26.2-forbric/mods` under an isolating launcher).

### 13.3 Where Forbric's own jars come from

The default build bundles them (`bundleForbric` writes `forbric-kernel-libraries.json` with SHA-1s). `-Pslim`
builds carry none and fetch at install time through `RemoteSource`: Forbric's jars from the GitHub release, other
libraries from Maven first. `-PreleasePin` compiles `forbric-release.properties` (tag, repo, `manifestSha256`) into
the jar — the digest of the manifest is the trust anchor, which is why release is two steps (`releaseAssets`,
then the pinned slim build). `releaseAssets` refuses to write assets unless `run/compat/evidence.py release-check`
confirms the kernel and merge-tools jars are byte-identical to the accepted candidate.

### 13.4 `--doctor`

`Doctor.examine` writes nothing, creates nothing, downloads nothing: platform, JVMs found, whether the base
version is installed, pins, which artifacts are present or will be built, expected disk, and a one-line verdict.

## 14. What `forbric-loader/` is still for

- **The merge tools.** `forbric-loader/src/tools/java/net/forbric/tools/` — `MergedBaseBuilder`,
  `MergedLinkChecker`, `RuntimeInteropPatcher`, plus `AdditiveMethodMerger`, `MergeabilityCensus`,
  `LostHookAttribution`, `EffectiveHookEvidence` — built by `:mergeToolsJar` into `forbric-merge-tools-0.1.0.jar`,
  which the installer ships and runs. The reviewed link baseline is
  `forbric-loader/src/test/resources/merge/link-check-baseline.txt`.
- **The developer pipeline.** `run/build-patched-forge.sh`, `assemble-minecraftforge-runtime.sh`,
  `assemble-neoforge-runtime.sh`, `build-merged-base.sh`, `check-merged-links.sh` produce the staged artifacts
  under `forbric-loader/run/{merged-base,forge-runtime,neoforge-runtime}/` that the kernel's game side compiles
  against and every gate runs on. `FORBRIC_OLD` (or `-Pforbric.stagedRoot`) points another worktree at them. The
  committed `run/merged-base/merge-conflicts.txt` is the merge's report.
- **Test inputs.** The canary mod sources in `run/livemod-src*`/`testmod-src` (`build-testmods.sh`), and the
  mod sets in its run directories that gate-m0's discovery oracle reads.
- **Installer payload.** The installer's bundle manifest still includes `net.forbric:forbric-loader` and
  `net.forbric:forbricruntime`, so an installed profile lists them as libraries. No kernel code names a
  `net.forbric.loader` class; the only reference is the retargeting in §6.

Its own boot path (Knot host, eight fabric-loader substrate patches applied by `bootstrap.sh`) is not used by the
kernel. The weld's design is documented in `forbric-loader/README.md` and `forbric-loader/run/README.md`.
`forbric-installer/` is the weld's installer and is not the one released.

## 16. Build and test

The current development entry point is `python3 tools/dev.py client` (Windows: `py tools/dev.py client`).
It prepares isolated game inputs under `forbric-kernel/.dev/` with the installer's artifact pipeline, resolves
libraries/assets and the pinned compile APIs, then builds and launches the current kernel. JDK 25+ and
Python 3.9+ are required. Gradle exposes `prepareDev`, `runClient`, `runServer` and `devDoctor`; preparation
and launch must be separate Gradle invocations because the game-side wiring is configured before tasks run.
See [the development guide](forbric-kernel/run/README.md) for commands and configuration.

`check` also runs development/evidence-tool self-tests and the packaged link gate's synthetic controls.
`integrationTest` requires the staged game and transfer suites and rejects any skipped test; ordinary `test`
still permits absent local fixtures and prints its executed/skipped counts. The complete integration suite
requires its named mod fixtures in addition to the base game; preparing the game is not a claim that every
compatibility pack or real-instance gate has run.

```sh
cd forbric-kernel
./gradlew --offline jar        # boot jar; nests forbric-kernel-runtime.jar only when the staged artifacts exist
./gradlew --offline test       # unit suite (depends on compileRuntimeJava)
./gradlew --offline check      # + transferTest (real Fabric/NeoForge transaction engines)
./run/gate-m0.sh               # build + suite from the JUnit XML + scan + link check + discovery oracle
java -cp <boot-cp> net.forbric.kernel.boot.Main --scan --mods <dir> --report out.json
```

- **Staged artifacts.** The game side compiles against `forbric-loader/run/merged-base/patched-mc-merged-26.2.jar`,
  `…/forge-runtime/forge-runtime.jar`, `…/neoforge-runtime/neoforge-runtime.jar`, plus brigadier, datafixerupper
  and gson from a local Minecraft install, a fabric-api jar for the transfer modules (`-Pforbric.fabricApi`), and
  Team Reborn Energy 5.0.0 pinned by SHA-256 (`run/energy-api/energy-5.0.0.jar` or `-Pforbric.rebornEnergy`).
  Without the staged jars `compileRuntimeJava` is skipped and `jar` produces a boot jar with no game side — which
  is what CI builds. `KernelRuntimeClasses.verify` is what catches such a jar at launch.
- **Unit tests.** Counted from source, not run: `src/test` has 2 624 `@Test` methods and 2 `@ParameterizedTest`
  methods (two cases each) in 438 `*Test.java` files; `src/transferTest` has 61 `@Test` methods in 4 files
  (annotations at line start, `grep` over tracked files). Many tests read the staged jars; gate-m0 fails on
  *any* skipped test, because a skip there means the tests did not look at the real base.
- **Gates.** 54 scripts, `forbric-kernel/run/gate-m*.sh`, each asserting on the real logs and files of a real
  instance, most with named negative controls (a `-D…=off` or input removal that must turn exactly the named
  checks red). `run/compat/gates-all.sh` discovers them by glob; `gates-parallel.py` overlaps them using each
  gate's `# GATE-PARALLEL: rundirs=… mem=…` line (51 of 54 carry one; a gate without it runs alone), giving each
  slot its own port block.

| Gate | Asserts |
| --- | --- |
| m0 | build, the whole suite, `--scan`, merged-base link check, discovery oracle, tool self-tests, transfer suite |
| m1, m3 | merged base to `Done` with zero mods and no genuine lifecycle; both Forge-family baselines + a real `@Mod` |
| m2, m2b | a real Fabric mod, then full fabric-api, with no Fabric Loader |
| m4, m4-canary, m7-neo | real mods of all three ecosystems in one server; pure NeoForge jars |
| m8, m10 | multiloader `pack.mcmeta` sections do not delete or break a pack |
| m9, m27 | client into a world and out cleanly with the 97-jar pack; a fresh non-black frame |
| m11 | a config-driven mod stack on a dedicated server |
| m12–m16 | client↔server over a real socket; a Paper anti-cheat; a pure Fabric server; MinecraftForge channels and handshake |
| m17 | the installer's profile, launched the way a launcher does |
| m18, m19, m20 | cross-ecosystem presence; a nested library initialised once; unmet dependency reaches the player |
| m21, m26, m28, m29 | MinecraftForge setup, client registration events, configs + live file watcher, capabilities |
| m22, m23 | quitting survives a replaced kernel jar; elytra flight |
| m24, m24b, m30 | a failing mod, a mod whose metadata cannot be read, and a partly failing mod, attributed on every surface |
| m24c | a jar listed in `forbric-disabled.txt` is loaded by nobody and named in the load report; a server only logs the crash-suspects offer |
| m25, m31, m32 | both biome-modifier pipelines; zero-mod worldgen parity with vanilla; a save opens with a mod removed |
| m33, m39, m40, m52 | item/fluid/energy transfer across ecosystems; hoppers into Fabric storages |
| m34 | ≥ 7200 s occupied simulation soak with retention checks |
| m35–m38, m41–m51, m53 | per-surface behaviour: mixin outcome, entity callbacks, enchantments, event chain, coremod parity, block break and loot, interaction, everyday actions, stub rebind, damage/server/world events, load predicates, tooltips, widened `NEW` anchors |

- **Compatibility sweeps.** `run/compat/PROTOCOL.md` is the procedure for running random/popular Modrinth sets on
  a Windows machine through the installed profile (`push-and-run.sh`, `win/*.py`, `pick_mods.py`, `evidence.py`),
  plus static tools (`abi-audit.py`, `field-drift.py`, `fapi-usage.py`, `hook-worklist.sh`, `repair-drift.sh`,
  `control-diff.sh` — same Fabric mods on native Fabric vs Forbric).
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): job `build` bootstraps and builds `forbric-loader/`. Job `kernel` (JDK 21,
  no game files) runs `./gradlew build -Pforbric.skipBaseline=ci-unstaged` in `forbric-kernel/`: the boot side
  compiles and the unit tests that need no game files run. About a third of the suite skips without game files,
  and that skipped set must equal `src/test/skip-baseline/ci-unstaged.tsv` line for line (`skipRatchet`,
  `tools/junit_report.py`): a test that starts skipping fails the job, and a line that stops skipping has to be
  deleted. The run page shows tests / executed / skipped with the most common skip reasons, and the JUnit reports
  are uploaded as `kernel-test-results`; regenerate the baseline from that artifact's `skips-actual-ci-unstaged.tsv`
  or with `-Pforbric.writeSkipBaseline`. Job `kernel-prepared` (JDK 25) first builds the game files on the runner
  with `tools/dev.py prepare --no-assets` (Minecraft from Mojang, Forge and NeoForge from their own mavens, the
  merged base and carriers built there, plus the two canary mods and the merge report the unit tests read; only
  upstream downloads are cached and nothing derived is uploaded), then runs the same suite plus `transferTest` with
  `-Pforbric.requireFixtures=staged,game-side,mc-libraries,java-25`: every kind of fixture except third-party mod
  packs is present there, so a skip for any other kind, or an untagged skip, fails the job at the test that skipped.
  The 136 tests that still skip all need third-party mod packs that are not in this repository, held to
  `ci-prepared.tsv` the same way. Job `development-tools` runs
  `tools/dev.py tool-test` and the packaged link gate on Windows, Linux and macOS. kernel-prepared then runs four
  real dedicated-server gates on the same files: m1, m36, m46 and m53, whose mods are canaries built from this
  repository. The other gates (client, third-party packs, soak) need the developer's Mac: `tools/nightly/` runs
  them there every night from launchd (02:30, the soak on Sundays), commits each night's summary to the branch
  `ci-results` and sets the commit status `nightly/dev-mac` on the tested commit.

## 17. System properties

Set with `-D` on the JVM. The installed profile sets none. There are about 250 distinct `forbric.*` names in
`src/main` and `src/runtime`; almost every repair has an `-Dforbric.<name>=off` switch, and turning one off logs a
WARN stating what is lost. Those switches exist for bisecting and for gates' negative controls. The ones a
developer reaches for:

**Policy and reporting**

| Property | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `forbric.compatibilityPolicy` | `ask` (default), `continue`, `strict`; anything else = `strict` |
| `forbric.dependencyDialog` | `on` (default), `off`, `dryRun` |
| `forbric.dialogLanguage` | force the dialog's language (e.g. `ja`) |
| `forbric.loadReportRewrite` | `off`: first write of `load-report.txt` wins |
| `forbric.crashAnalysis` | `off`: no `crash-analysis.txt` |
| `forbric.debug` | enable `ForbricLog.debug` lines |

**Arbitration and order**

| Property | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `forbric.multiLoaderPreference` | per-jar ecosystem order, default `neoforge,minecraftforge,fabric` |
| `forbric.dupeIdPreference`, `forbric.nestedDupePreference` | cross-jar order for top-level / nested duplicates |
| `forbric.modOwner` | `id=loader,…` pins; also `<rundir>/forbric-mods.txt` |
| `forbric.crossJarArbitration` | `off`: two jars with one id both load |
| `forbric.arbitrationMaxNodes` | selector work bound (default 100 000, capped at 1 000 000) |
| `forbric.modOrder` | `name`: file-name construction order |
| `forbric.fabricOrder` | `off`: Fabric mods follow the topological order instead of mod-id order |
| `forbric.fabricMainInConstructor` | `off`: client Fabric `main` entrypoints run in the pre-`Minecraft` window |
| `forbric.loaderProbes`, `forbric.crossEcosystemPresence` | `off`: platform probes / presence answer as a single loader would |

**Mixin**

| Property | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `forbric.relaxGuestMixins` | `off`: guest configs are not relaxed |
| `forbric.relaxMixinOverwrites` | csv (`*` glob) of configs to relax |
| `forbric.mixinDiagnostics` | keep injection requirements strict to surface every misfit |
| `forbric.mixinFit` | `strict`: also drop `PARTIAL` mixins |
| `forbric.mixinFit.liveness` | `off`: injectors on uncalled methods count as resolved |
| `forbric.mixinOverlapLint` | `off`: no cross-mod overlap findings at boot (§7.6) |
| `forbric.guestMixinAdapter` | `off`: no derived drops, only the hand list |
| `forbric.mergedBaseCompat` | `off`: drop the built-in incompatibility lists |
| `forbric.disableMixinConfigs`, `forbric.enableMixinConfigs` | csv of configs to disable / force on |
| `forbric.suppressMixins`, `forbric.keepMixins` | csv of `config:Mixin` to drop / keep |

**Diagnostics and test drivers**

| Property | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `forbric.clientSmoke` (+ `clientSmokeWorld`, `clientSmokeReadyTicks`, `clientSmokeDisconnectTicks`, …) | unattended client run: enter a world, live, leave, exit |
| `forbric.eventChainAudit` | report file for the cross-bus audit |
| `forbric.definedClassEvidence` | directory for a content-addressed record of every defined class |
| `forbric.traceClassDefine` | csv of binary names; log a stack the first time each is defined |
| `forbric.tickSampler` | `off`: no server tick-time sampling |

**Selected repair switches** — `forbric.commonNetworkInterop`, `forbric.chunkExecutorGuard`,
`forbric.forgeCapabilities`, `forbric.forgeWorldgen`, `forbric.transferBridge`, `forbric.hopperFabricStorage`,
`forbric.clientResourcePreload`, `forbric.earlyConfigs`, `forbric.fabricHooks`, `forbric.fabricImpl`,
`forbric.kernelBundledFirst`, `forbric.modDataPacks`. `forbric.kernel.registryRedirect=true` enables an
experimental registry-wrapper redirect.

## 18. Invariants

Break one and the failure usually surfaces far from the cause.

1. **Boot code names no game type.** It reaches the game side by string, and every such string is in
   `KernelRuntimeClasses`. Anything shared across the boundary is `ALWAYS_PARENT`; anything game-side is
   `ALWAYS_GAME`. One copy of each per JVM.
2. **`MIXIN` is terminal.** Nothing registers into it through `TransformChain`; Mixin is served pre-Mixin bytes;
   the post-Mixin stage order is fixed.
3. **Loader identity exists before the first class reaches the Mixin transformer.** Seeding after that point
   lets a guest plugin's `<clinit>` decide MinecraftForge's `dist` forever.
4. **One registration window, one freeze.** Content registration happens between `unfreeze` and
   `closeRegistrationWindow`; the client reopens once, for its entrypoints, and re-freezes.
5. **The lifecycle trigger is redirected or the kernel does not boot.**
6. **Game buses start before setup phases; the payload phase closes after them.**
7. **Arbitration decides once.** The pre-scan's plan is consumed by both discoveries; later passes verify, never
   re-choose. Selection is bounded by work, not time.
8. **A repair that stands down says so** — `AnchorSet`/`AnchorLedger`, `EventBridges.verify`, a WARN per switch.
9. **Attribution never changes an outcome.** Error handlers and reports record; Mixin's decision and a mod's
   failure are left as they were. `CompatibilityDecision` never exits the JVM; only the launch boundary does.
10. **Nothing carrying Mojang, MinecraftForge or NeoForge bytes is committed or shipped.** The game side links
    against staged jars `compileOnly`; the installer builds them on the player's machine.

## 19. Current state and known boundaries

- **Minecraft 26.2 only**, Mojmap identity namespace. There is no remapping step: a jar compiled against another
  namespace is not translated (`kernel/mapping/` is carried over from the weld and is not on the boot path).
- **The merged base is NeoForge's game with MinecraftForge spliced in.** Where both patched a method, one body
  survived (1 000 method conflicts in the committed report); what the loser's mods lose is repaired case by case —
  transformers, adapters, bridges — and what is not repaired is reported by `DeadEventAudit`,
  `HookCallSiteCensus`, `FieldDriftAudit`, `AbiLinkAudit`, `CapabilityUseAudit`. Structural conflicts (two real
  superclasses for `Entity`) have no bytecode-level resolution; MinecraftForge capabilities are composed back in by
  transformer.
- **`PARTIAL` mixins apply by default** — half-application is kept, visible, in preference to dropping working
  hooks.
- **One class, one copy.** When two ecosystems' builds of a mod compete, one wins; the losing ecosystem sees a
  presence alias, not the mod's own platform glue.
- **Measured, not promised.** `MOD_TEST_FAILURES.md` records a per-mod test (each jar alone with its required
  dependencies, into a world, screenshot, exit) on three fresh random Modrinth sets against the current `main`
  code: 89.0 % loaded without failure lines on average (91.8 % reached the world; 79.1 % with nothing reported
  DEGRADED in the load report), against 80.5 % for release v0.2.0 on the same jars.
- **Versions.** `forbric-kernel/build.gradle` says `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`; the installer is `0.3.1-beta2`. `net.forbric.api`
  is internal and changes without notice.
