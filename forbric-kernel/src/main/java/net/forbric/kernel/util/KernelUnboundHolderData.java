/**
 * Says so when a data-map lookup is answered "no data" for a value that was still not registered when its registry
 * closed — the one case where the answer {@code UnboundHolderDataInjector} gives can hide a defect instead of fixing one.
 *
 * <p>The merged {@code Holder.Reference.getData} answers {@code null} for an intrusive holder with no key, where native
 * NeoForge throws {@code Trying to access unbound value}. While its registry is still open for registration that is the
 * expected state: the value was constructed and is about to be registered, which is when fabric-api's
 * {@code OxidizableBlocksRegistry.registerNextStage} asks a block for its next stage, and nothing is logged. Once a
 * {@code frozen} flag of the owning registry is set, the registry has been through {@code freeze()}, which throws
 * "Some intrusive holders were not registered" for such a value (setting {@code frozen} first), and native NeoForge
 * would have thrown at this lookup. The value is not necessarily lost for good: both registries named
 * below have an {@code unfreeze()}, and Forbric reopens the registries for the Fabric client entrypoints, so a value
 * registered there was only asked about early. Either way the lookup still answers "no data", and the first one for
 * each such value is a WARN with the stack that asked, so a value that is never registered is not hidden.
 *
 * <p>The owner is asked for {@code frozen} reflectively, every non-static {@code boolean frozen} its class hierarchy
 * declares: vanilla's {@code MappedRegistry.frozen}, which its {@code freeze()} sets and its {@code validateWrite} reads
 * (registration, intrusive holders, tags), and, on a MinecraftForge {@code NamespacedWrapper}, the wrapper's own, which
 * the wrapper's {@code freeze()} sets and its {@code validateWrite} reads (intrusive holders, tags; its
 * {@code register} is gated by a separate {@code locked}). Any set counts as closed. An owner with no such field, or
 * one it cannot read, is not judged and nothing is warned.
 *
 * <p>Diagnostics only: nothing here changes the answer, and nothing here throws. Like {@link KernelChunkExecutorGuard} it
 * names no game type, so it lives in this parent-loaded package and is called from the repaired game class.
