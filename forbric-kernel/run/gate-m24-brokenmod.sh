# M24 expected-failure policy gate — continuation is explicit and failure evidence never turns green.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every other gate here asserts that NO mod failed: gate-m4 and gate-m7 each carry a
# check_absent "no @Mod construction failure". That is the right assertion for those gates and it is the exact
# opposite of this one. Nothing anywhere proved the other half.
#
# And the other half is the cost of Forbric's whole posture. Real loaders stop and show an error screen; Forbric
# deliberately loads as much as it can and carries on (DependencyAudit and KernelLifecycle both say so in as many
# words). The price of that trade is that a failure must not spread, and must not vanish — for most of this
# project's life a failed mod was one WARN line in a ten-thousand-line log, and the README's own advice was to
# remove half your mods and try again.
#
# So: stage a mod that fails on purpose next to two healthy ones, and assert all three halves — the healthy mods
# still load under explicit continue, and the broken one remains a confirmed necessary failure in the report.
# Strict policy must stop the same broken pack before Done. A final clean control must start under strict.
