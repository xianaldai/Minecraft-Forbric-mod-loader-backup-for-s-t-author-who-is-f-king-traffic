# M55 — the creative inventory's search finds items after a mod refreshed the search the vanilla way.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The merged SessionSearchTrees kept MinecraftForge's bodies for vanilla's two search-tree producers
# (updateCreativeTooltips(Provider, List), updateCreativeTags(List)), which file their trees in a private map, while
# the creative screen is NeoForge's and reads NeoForge's CreativeModeTabSearchRegistry. The screen builds its own
# trees only when CreativeModeTabs.tryRebuildTabContents reports a change, so a mod that rebuilds the tabs itself and
# refreshes the search the vanilla way — TCDCommons, Better Stats' library, on every join — left every creative
# search empty for the session. canary/creative-search does exactly that and nothing else.
#
# WHAT IT JUDGES. The creative screen's own grid: the client-smoke probe opens the real CreativeModeInventoryScreen,
# types into its search box through charTyped and logs how many stacks the grid holds. Not the kernel's log line.
#
#   0. baseline — no canary: what the screen's own rebuild finds for each query. The yardstick, measured rather than
#      written down, so a world or feature-flag change moves both sides at once.
#   1. repaired — the canary's refresh ran, and the search tab finds exactly the baseline's stacks for "stone"
#      (minecraft:stone first), a namespaced id and a # tag, twice and again after a language-change rebuild.
#   2. off — -Dforbric.creativeSearchTrees=off: the same canary, and every one of those searches finds nothing in
#      both passes. The negative control: it proves the canary reproduces the bug, so the green in phase 1 is the
#      repair's.
