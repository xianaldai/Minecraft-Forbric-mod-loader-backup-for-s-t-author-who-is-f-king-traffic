/**
 * Offers the kernel's stand-in for Mod Menu's API to the game class loader, when no installed jar has the real one.
 *
 * <h2>The failure it prevents</h2>
 *
 * <p>A Fabric mod's config screen is reachable from exactly one declaration: a {@code "modmenu"} entrypoint whose
 * class implements {@code com.terraformersmc.modmenu.api.ModMenuApi}. Fabric itself has no config-screen API, so
 * that interface belongs to the Mod Menu MOD — and on an instance without Mod Menu the entrypoint class cannot be
 * linked at all. The kernel's Mods screen asked Mod Menu for Fabric configs and, finding none installed, showed no
 * Config button for any Fabric mod. A player's pack had 17 Fabric mods declaring one and no Mod Menu, and the Mods
 * screen offered none of their settings ({@code mods with a config screen: 0 Fabric}) — only the mods with their own
 * way in, such as a hotkey or a button on the video settings, could be configured at all.
 *
 * <p>With the five API types present, those entrypoints link and {@code KernelModConfigScreens} reads them the way
 * Mod Menu's own client initializer does. Only the API package is stood in for, plus the {@code NullScreenFactory} its default
 * returns: the mod id {@code modmenu} stays unloaded, and Mod Menu's internals ({@code com.terraformersmc.modmenu.gui.ModsScreen}, the target of Do a Barrel
 * Roll's Mod-Menu-only mixin) stay absent, so code guarded by {@code isModLoaded("modmenu")} keeps skipping.
 *
 * <h2>Why a real Mod Menu always wins</h2>
 *
 * <p>Twice over. This checks first and offers nothing when any owned jar — top level or extracted from a jar-in-jar,
 * both are owned by the time this runs — has {@code ModMenuApi.class}. And the bytes go to
 * {@link ForbricClassLoader#putGeneratedClass}, which the loader consults only after every owned jar has missed the
 * class, so even an offered stand-in could not shadow a jar's copy. The bytes are compiled from
 * {@code src/modmenuApi/java} and shipped as RESOURCES in the game-side jar, under a {@code .class.bin} name no class
 * loader resolves; as class files there they would be one of the loader's own jars and would win.
 *
 * <p>Client only: Mod Menu is a client mod, its API names client screens, and nothing on a dedicated server reads a
 * {@code "modmenu"} entrypoint. {@code -Dforbric.modMenuStandIn=off} restores the old behaviour — no stand-in, and a
 * Fabric mod gets a Config button only from an installed Mod Menu.
