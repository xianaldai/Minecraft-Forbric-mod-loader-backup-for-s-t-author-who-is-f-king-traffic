/**
 * What discovery learned about a mod, in the plainest form the two {@code IModInfo} implementations can share.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both implementations are built from a mod id and a jar path and nothing else, so both answered
 * {@code getVersion()} with the placeholder "0.0" and {@code getDisplayName()} with the mod id. The kernel had
 * the real values the whole time — discovery parses them out of every mod's own metadata file — they were simply
 * never carried across to the objects NeoForge hands to mods. So the Mods screen listed a column of ids at
 * version 0.0, and a mod comparing another mod's version against a requirement got a number below every
 * requirement.
 *
 * <p>Strings, not version objects. The two Forge families each have their own {@code ArtifactVersion}, and a
 * helper that returned one would force a cross-family type on the other; each caller builds its own family's.
