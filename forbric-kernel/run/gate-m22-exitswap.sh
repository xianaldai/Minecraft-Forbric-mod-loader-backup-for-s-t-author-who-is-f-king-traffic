# M22 gate — a quit stays a quit when the kernel jar stops being readable.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The exit hook is spliced into Minecraft.close, so the first and only attempt to load
# net.forbric.kernel.interop.ClientShutdown used to happen while the game was shutting down. On a real install
# that produced three "Game shutdown / NoClassDefFoundError" crash reports in one evening — from sessions whose
# kernel jar had been REPLACED on disk while they ran (a developer redeploying mid-session), with a session
# started after the last write exiting clean. The class was in both jars the whole time; it simply had not been
# loaded yet when the file underneath it changed.
#
# A jar swapped under a live JVM is one way to reach that. A jar on a network or removable volume is another. The
# player's report is the same either way: quitting the game is reported by the launcher as a crash.
#
# So this launches with a COPY of the boot jar, destroys that copy while the client is in a world, and asserts
# the quit is still a quit. The destruction is total (the file is truncated), which is far beyond a swap — if the
# shutdown path survives that, it survives a replacement.
#
# The exit hook was not the only class read late. Every hook spliced into the game is read from the jar at its first
# use: the first nightly (2026-10-05) crashed the server here when the first lava flow came after the truncation
# (NoClassDefFoundError: net/forbric/kernel/interop/ForgeRuntimeInterop, through MinecraftForge's fluid rules), and
# every run, green ones included, logged NoClassDefFoundError: net/forbric/kernel/boot/KernelRegistryRevert when the
# client left the world — this gate only looked for the interop package, so that one never counted. The kernel now
# defines its whole jar at boot (KernelJarPreload), and the absence check below covers every kernel class.
#
# RED control: M22_EXTRA_JVM='-Dforbric.bootJarPreload=off' — the disconnect's KernelRegistryRevert fails again.
# GATE-PARALLEL: clone=client-merged-pack:M22_RUNDIR mem=3000
