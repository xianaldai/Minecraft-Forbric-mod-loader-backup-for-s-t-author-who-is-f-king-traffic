/**
 * Arbitrates the common-networking channel that Fabric and NeoForge <em>both</em> claim on a tri-in-one instance.
 *
 * <p>Both ecosystems implement the cross-loader "Common Networking" spec — version + channel negotiation over the
 * {@code c:version}/{@code c:register} wire channels — each with its OWN payload class registered for the same id.
 * On a normal instance only one ecosystem is present, so only one registration exists; on Forbric both do, and the
 * decode registry hands a {@code net.neoforged.…CommonVersionPayload} to Fabric's addon, whose handler casts it to
 * {@code net.fabricmc.…CommonVersionPayload} → {@code ClassCastException} → the client is kicked "The server sent an
 * invalid packet" right after reaching the world.
 *
 * <p>The translation logic lives in {@link net.forbric.kernel.interop.PayloadInterop} — boot-side, purely
 * reflective, and a kernel class since the interop hooks were brought over from the previous-generation loader:
 * given the addon and the incoming payload it runs the negotiation for BOTH stacks
 * — extracting the version, feeding Fabric's {@code onCommonVersionPacket} and NeoForge's {@code checkCommonVersion}
 * — and reports whether it fully handled the packet. This injector installs the two call sites the old loader
 * reached via mixins, but as kernel-native head injections (the kernel authors no mixins of its own):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code AbstractChanneledNetworkAddon.handle(CustomPacketPayload)} — a guest Fabric class the kernel's
 *       transforming loader also defines. If the interop reports the packet handled, return its verdict before
 *       Fabric's {@code receive} can miscast it. This is the one that stops the client CCE.</li>
 *   <li>{@code ServerConfigurationPacketListenerImpl.finishCurrentTask(ConfigurationTask.Type)} — the two stacks
 *       expose different {@code ConfigurationTask.Type}s for the same handshake, so accept either owner at the
 *       task-completion boundary.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The interop methods take {@code Object} parameters, so the injected {@code INVOKESTATIC} can pass {@code this}
 * and the argument as-is — no need for the boot-side hook to name {@code net.minecraft}/{@code net.fabricmc} types
 * (the same widening-reference trick {@link ClientPackHookInjector} relies on).

	 * <p>The {@code POP} is the bug. Forge's hook answers "was this mine, and did I take it" and the override

	 * {@code ServerCommonPacketListenerImpl}, which is exactly that super, so a NeoForge mod's play-phase packet
	 * to the server arrived, was offered to MinecraftForge, declined, and stopped. No exception, no log: the
	 * mod's server-side handler simply never ran, while clientbound traffic and both other families' packets
	 * worked. Every GUI button, keybind action and config-sync request a NeoForge mod sends upward was dead, in
	 * singleplayer too, because the integrated server takes the same path.
	 *
	 * <p>So the {@code POP} becomes a branch: if MinecraftForge took it, return; otherwise, if NeoForge registered
	 * it, call {@code NetworkRegistry.handleModdedPayload(this, packet)} — the call NeoForge's own super body makes
	 * for a mod payload, with NeoForge's own channel check and handler lookup inside it. NOT {@code super} itself:
	 * fabric-api injects into that super a handler that serves only the configuration listener and throws
	 * {@code IllegalStateException: Unknown addon} for this one, so reaching it disconnects the player the first
	 * time a NeoForge mod sends anything — measured, with Carry On's key packet and fabric-api installed. Written
	 * against the POP that FOLLOWS the hook rather than against an offset, so a carrier that adds an instruction
	 * before it does not silently land the branch somewhere else — and if that pattern is not found, nothing is

	 * at two different depths of the same call chain. NeoForge patched the vanilla override:
	 * <pre>
	 *   ClientConfigurationPacketListenerImpl.handleCustomPayload(packet) {
	 *       if (!initializedConnection &amp;&amp; packet.payload() instanceof MinecraftRegisterPayload) {
	 *           ClientNetworkRegistry.sendInitialListeningChannels(this);   // NeoForge's channel list goes out
	 *           return;                                                     // ← never reaches super
	 *       }
	 *       ...
	 *       super.handleCustomPayload(packet);
	 *   }
	 * </pre>
	 * while Fabric injects its dispatch at the HEAD of the SUPERCLASS's {@code handleCustomPayload}. On a real
	 * NeoForge instance nothing is downstream of that {@code return}; on a real Fabric instance the override does
	 * not exist. Only on a merged base does one ecosystem's early exit starve the other's entry point — and
	 * Fabric's {@code ClientConfigurationNetworkAddon.receiveRegistration} is the SOLE caller of
	 * {@code sendInitialChannelRegistrationPacket()}, so the client never declared a single Fabric channel.
	 *
	 * <p>Merely appending the super call before that {@code return} is not enough, and the reason is a contract on
	 * the OTHER end of the wire. Fabric's {@code ServerConfigurationNetworkAddon.receiveRegistration} treats the
	 * client's FIRST {@code minecraft:register} as its complete declaration: it flips {@code SENT → RECEIVED} and
	 * calls {@code startConfiguration()} synchronously, which runs {@code RegistrySyncManager.configureClient} and
	 * its {@code canSend(fabric:registry/sync)} check right there. If NeoForge's list has gone out first, that check
	 * sees seven NeoForge channels and kicks with "This server requires Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed on
	 * your client!" — while Fabric's list is one packet behind on the same socket. A pure Fabric server would do the

	 * Fabric's. NeoForge's {@code NetworkRegistry.onMinecraftRegister} is purely additive and order-blind, so a
	 * NeoForge server is indifferent to which list arrives first.
	 *
	 * <p>Hence the super call is spliced in BEFORE {@code sendInitialListeningChannels}, not before the
	 * {@code return}: Fabric sees the payload (once — our addon prologue translates it and cancels the vanilla body)
	 * and replies, then NeoForge replies, then the override returns as it always did. NeoForge's own guard stays
	 * the condition — no duplicate of {@code initializedConnection} to drift — and no branch target is added, so
	 * every original stack map frame stays valid.
