# M45 — the things every player does: craft, smelt, brew, swim, meet the Ender Dragon. Each of them threw on the merged base.
#
#   crafting remainders — fabric-item-api-v1's class tweaker injects FabricItem into Item, whose merged hierarchy has
#     MinecraftForge's IForgeItem; both default getCraftingRemainder(ItemStack), so with fabric-api installed every
#     crafting-table result, brew and bucket fuel threw IncompatibleClassChangeError (InterfaceDefaultConflictRepair now
#     judges a conflict against the jar's own interfaces and settles this one through NeoForge's overload).
#   smelting — NeoForge's furnace tick calls MinecraftForge's instance canBurn/consumeFuel/burn as static: every furnace
#     threw on its first smelt (FurnaceTickCallsInjector calls them on the ticked furnace).
#   the Ender Dragon — its parts were MinecraftForge PartEntitys while every consumer is NeoForge-typed; NeoForge's
#     getParts() answered null, so adding a dragon threw and a server holding one could not stop. No runtime rewrite
#     repairs this any more: the merged-base builder proves MinecraftForge's PartEntity and NeoForge's immutable
#     behavioural equivalents and bridges one onto the other (EquivalentSuperclassBridge / RuntimeInteropPatcher), and
#     EnderDragon keeps both getParts() descriptors over its one part array. The loader reports that ancestor edge as it
#     defines it ("[Forbric/Hierarchy] …", PlatformAncestorBridges — any cross-platform-carrier superclass, no names).
# A dedicated server with a probe mod (canary/everyday-actions) and the unmodified fabric-item-api-v1:
#   remainders through ItemStack, Item(ItemStack) and NeoForge's Item(ItemInstance) (control); a cake crafted from its
#   recipe leaves three buckets; an idle furnace ticks (control) and a lit one smelts raw iron; a brewing stand makes
#   awkward potions; a pig stands in a Fabric mod's untagged fluid (no interaction) and in its water-tagged fluid (it
#   swims), and MinecraftForge's fluid type of each is its water or empty type; a dragon is added and found by its part, hurt through it, and removed; the server stops cleanly.
#   Fabric fuels — fabric-content-registries fires its fuel events from vanilla's vanillaBurnTimes, which the merged
#     game never calls (it builds fuels from NeoForge's data map), so a Fabric mod's fuel could not go in a furnace
#     (FabricFuelValuesInjector runs them on NeoForge's builder): coal (control), the probe mod's dirt fuel, and the
#     carpets its exclusion removes.
#   Fabric fluids — a Fabric mod's fluid declares no NeoForge FluidType, and NeoForge's lookup threw "Mod fluids must
#     override getFluidType" at the first entity to touch one: 'Ticking entity' took the server down
#     (ForeignFluidTypeInjector gives it the type its fluid tags imply).
#
#   1. positive — STRICT, every case passes, zero confirmed required findings, no exception on stop; each runtime
#      repair logs its line, and the loader reports the PartEntity ancestor bridge in effect.
#   2. off — -Dforbric.defaultConflictRepair=off -Dforbric.furnaceTickCalls=off -Dforbric.foreignFluidTypes=off
#      -Dforbric.fabricFuel=off -Dforbric.forgePartTracking=off: exactly the runtime-repaired cases fail and the controls
#      hold. The dragon is now a control here: its fix is the merged base's bridge, which has no runtime switch, so the
#      three dragon cases must PASS with every runtime repair off and the bridge line must still appear. forgePartTracking
#      stays off to show the dragon does not lean on that runtime guard (it reads a null NeoForge getParts() as "no
#      parts"; with the bridge the dragon's NeoForge getParts() answers its real parts, so the guard is never needed).
#      The old -Dforbric.dragonParts switch was removed with the runtime rewrite it controlled.
# Not covered here: a client (the dragon's parts in the client's entity lookups), and a native server as an oracle.
