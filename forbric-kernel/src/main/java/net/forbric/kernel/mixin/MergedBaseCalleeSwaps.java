/**
 * Descriptor-identical callee swaps the merge made inside vanilla method bodies, and the few a guest mixin's
 * {@code @At(INVOKE)} may follow.
 *
 * <p>A second, narrower table, {@link #SUBSTITUTED}, holds the swaps that change the callee's owner, name or return
 * type as well: see {@link Substitution}. Only an {@code @Inject} may follow one of those.
 *
 * <p>A third, {@link #REPLACED}, holds a private vanilla method the carrier replaced outright — renamed and reshaped, at
 * its one call site — with one taking what vanilla's arguments are read from: see {@link Replaced}.
 *
 * <p>Where NeoForge's patch of a vanilla method replaces one call with another of the same descriptor on the
 * same owner — {@code BlockState.isAir()Z} → {@code isEmpty()Z} in {@code LevelChunkSection.setBlockState} —
 * a mixin anchored on the vanilla callee misses. The census in {@code MergedBaseCalleeSwapTest} finds every such
 * swap between stock 26.2 and the merged base and classifies each with a safety test: is the merged callee a
 * pure delegate of the vanilla one (or vice versa)? Today NONE is — every swap is a NeoForge behaviour change
 * ({@code isEmpty} is an overridable {@code IBlockStateExtension} default, not a rename) — so no base-side
 * call-site rewrite exists, and the census asserts that it must not.
 *
 * <p>What CAN be argued is per mixin, not per call site: fabric-block-api-v1's {@code modifyAirCheck} handler
 * body is exactly {@code is(AIR) || is(CAVE_AIR) || is(VOID_AIR)}, byte-for-byte the predicate NeoForge's
 * default {@code isEmpty} computes. Retargeting that {@code @Redirect} to {@code isEmpty} keeps NeoForge's
 * semantics on every block and only overrides a block-level {@code isEmpty} override — which the Fabric handler
 * could never honour on any loader. Each row here carries that argument in {@code because}; the census asserts
 * the rows are a subset of the swaps it finds, so a rebuild that removes the swap turns the row red.
