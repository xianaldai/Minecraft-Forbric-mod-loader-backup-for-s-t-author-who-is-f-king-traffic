	 * {@code INVOKESTATIC net/forbric/loader/impl/compat/ForbricCustomPayloadInterop.findCodec} into the merged
	 * {@code CustomPacketPayload} codec provider. Those three helper classes now live in the kernel
	 * ({@code net.forbric.kernel.interop}) and the old loader jars are no longer on the boot classpath, so the
	 * baked-in owner names no longer resolve — the symptom is a {@code NoClassDefFoundError} inside the netty
	 * encoder the moment anything sends a custom payload, i.e. every world join.
	 *
	 * <p>This is a permanent adaptation, not a one-off migration step: the base-building pipeline belongs to the
	 * other repository and keeps emitting the names it knows. The kernel owns what its own base links against, so
	 * it retargets them here rather than requiring a 35 MB artifact to be rebuilt in lockstep.
	 *
	 * <p>The only shape the builder emits is a method owner. Anything else carrying the legacy prefix — a field
	 * owner, a {@code new}, a class constant — would survive this pass and fail at link time far away from here,
	 * so {@link #stillNamesTheOldLoader} re-reads the finished bytes and says so out loud.

	 * reproducible where features do not read their neighbours) measured it: biomes differ in 11 of 1764 chunks
	 * and heightmaps in 90 of 400 fully generated ones, where vanilla against itself differs in 0 and 10.</li>
	 * <li>{@code nextDouble()} can return exactly {@code 1.0}, for every {@code bits >= 9007198986305536} — about
	 * one draw in 2^25. Every caller in the game assumes the half-open range; an index computed as

	 * {@code AbstractMethodError: KeyMapping.setKeyConflictContext(…IKeyConflictContext) is abstract}.
	 *
	 * <p>First: the merged class kept NeoForge's accessors and MinecraftForge's constructors and FIELDS, but not
	 * MinecraftForge's accessors — an abstract method has no body for the splice to take. Any Forge mod that
	 * configures a keybinding therefore fails, and it fails in a class initializer, so the mod loses everything
	 * downstream of it.
	 *
	 * <p>Second, and the reason re-adding the methods over the MinecraftForge fields would have been worse than
	 * the crash: those fields are DEAD. Every live consumer reads NeoForge's — {@code same()} resolves conflicts
	 * through the NeoForge-typed {@code getKeyConflictContext}, and {@code isActiveAndMatches} /
	 * {@code setToDefault} / {@code isConflictContextAndModifierActive} all delegate into
	 * {@code IKeyMappingExtension}. A setter that wrote the MinecraftForge field would stop the crash and leave
	 * the binding behaving as though the mod had never set a context at all.
	 *
	 * <p>So the MinecraftForge face is adapted onto the NeoForge state, in both directions, through
	 * {@code KernelForgeKeyBindings}. The same reason applies to the MinecraftForge-typed CONSTRUCTORS, which
	 * write only the dead fields and leave the NeoForge ones null — a mod using one gets a mapping whose first

	 *       Reads {@code pictureInPictureRendererPools} instead, and returns false for a state class with no pool.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>Every guest mod registers into the first map, because that is the only one vanilla has: Xaero's Minimap puts

	 * lookup misses one map over.
	 *
	 * <p>So the null-pool branch now falls through to the orphaned map instead of returning false. Guest renderers get
	 * exactly vanilla's contract — one instance per state class, {@code prepare} called directly — and NeoForge's
	 * pooled renderers are untouched, which matters: a pool CLOSES the renderers a frame did not use, so handing a
