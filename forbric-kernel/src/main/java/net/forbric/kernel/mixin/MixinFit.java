/**
 * Decides whether a guest mixin still FITS the merged base, by resolving every anchor it names against the merged
 * target's actual bytecode.
 *
 * <h2>Why resolution and not provenance</h2>
 *
 * <p>The merged base IS NeoForge's patched Minecraft — {@code MergedBaseBuilder} takes NeoForge as the base and
 * splices Forge in, so its own report reads {@code forge=195 neo=10161 MERGED=611}. "The target is a class
 * Forge/NeoForge owns" therefore describes ~93% of every class in the jar: it is the normal state, not a hazard
 * signal. Measured over the 163 suppressions the previous owned-target rule actually made, 108 (66%) targeted a
 * class BYTE-IDENTICAL to NeoForge's own patched jar.
 *
 * <p>Nor does provenance answer the question even when it is exact. Iris's {@code MixinLevelRenderer} anchors on
 * {@code lambda$addSkyPass$8}, {@code lambda$addCloudsPass$3}, {@code lambda$addMainPass$1} — none of which exist in
 * the merged {@code LevelRenderer}, and none of which exist in the VANILLA jar either, because lambda numbering is
 * an artifact of the remap toolchain rather than of the merge. "Neo-identical" does not imply "vanilla-equivalent".
 * The only question that predicts breakage is the direct one: <em>do the members this mixin names still exist?</em>
 *
 * <h2>Why the decision is atomic per mixin</h2>
 *
 * <p>A partially applied mixin is worse than either extreme. {@code relax}'s {@code injectors.defaultRequire=0}
 * silently skips individual non-matching injections, which today leaves Iris's {@code MixinLevelRenderer} with 16 of
 * its 25 injections installed — frame-graph entry hooks bound, the lambda-side exits dropped, i.e. a shader pipeline
 * that binds render targets it never unbinds. So this returns one verdict for the whole mixin and the caller drops
 * all of it or none of it. {@code relax} stays as a second-chance net for what cannot be resolved statically
 * ({@code @At(value="CONSTANT")}, MixinExtras expressions, {@code ordinal}/{@code shift}).
 *
 * <h2>Conservative by construction</h2>
 *
 * <p>Anything this cannot parse counts as RESOLVED. A weak parser must never be the reason a working mixin is
 * dropped; the cost of a false negative is a mixin that misbehaves as it does today, while the cost of a false
 * positive is silently deleting behaviour that worked.
