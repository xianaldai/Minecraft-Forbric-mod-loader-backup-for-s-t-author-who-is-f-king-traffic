# M2b gate — the FULL Fabric ecosystem runs on the sovereign kernel: fabric-api (43 modules, 58 mixin configs,
# 33 access wideners) plus a real third-party Fabric mod, on the merged 3-ABI base, with NO Fabric Loader.
#
# What this exercises beyond M2a: the kernel IS the Mixin service (ForbricMixinService), MixinExtras is bootstrapped
# game-side, class tweakers (access wideners) are applied before Mixin, and the MC libraries are owned by the
# transforming loader so mods can mixin into them (fabric-dimension-api-v1 injects an interface into DataFixerUpper).
#
# NO compatibility flags are passed. The merged-base incompatibilities are shipped defaults in
# MergedBaseMixinCompat, so an installed instance boots as-is. Each entry there costs a real feature and is
# documented at its declaration; `run/mixin-inventory.sh` rediscovers the list from scratch.
#
# Optional reproduction of the real nested-library collision (all existing assertions remain enabled):
# M2B_FABRIC_API=/path/to/fabric-api-0.161.0+26.2.jar \
# M2B_BADPACKETS=/path/to/badpackets-forge-0.12.2.jar run/gate-m2b.sh
# RED: add M2B_EXTRA_JVM=-Dforbric.kernelBundledFirst=off. The nested MixinExtras 0.3.5 then wins over
# the supplied version, so the version/source assertions fail; the newer FAPI also requires EXPRESSION.
# GATE-PARALLEL: rundirs=server-fabric-api mem=2000
