/**
 * The dependency audit runs after the thing that writes half of what it reports.
 *
 * <p>Its second section lists mixins a mod wrote to attach to ANOTHER mod which did not attach — recorded by
 * KernelGuestMixinAdapter while Mixin parses each config, i.e. inside KernelMixinBootstrap.init. The audit used
 * to run from inside the NeoForge seeder, roughly thirty lines earlier in the same method, so the reader ran
 * before the writer every single time and ForeignMixinBreaks.all() was always empty. That section of the
 * player-facing dialog had never displayed anything.
 *
 * <p>gate-m20 could not catch it: it drives the dialog directly with synthetic rows, which is the right way to
 * test the dialog and no way at all to test when it is fed. Hence an ordering assertion here.
