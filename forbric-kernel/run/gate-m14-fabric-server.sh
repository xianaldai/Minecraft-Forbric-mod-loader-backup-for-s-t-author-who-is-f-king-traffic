# M14 gate — a Forbric client on a PURE Fabric server, with a mod set that differs from the server's.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. gate-m12 syncs registries between two Forbric ends, where NeoForge's registry sync runs and
# the kernel applies it to the seventeen MinecraftForge-wrapped registries. Against a pure Fabric server only
# fabric-api's sync runs, and its remap was a silent no-op on those wrappers: it rewrites MappedRegistry fields the
# wrapper never fills. With identical mod sets that costs nothing — the ids already agree — so the only way to see
# it is a client whose registry order DIFFERS from the server's. This gate builds that difference on purpose and
# then asks the one question that matters: does a block the server places decode to the same block on the client?
#
# THE DIFFERENCE. Both ends run fabric-api + Macaw's Bridges (303 blocks/items). The client ALSO carries the
# kernel's Fabric canary, which registers one block and one item before any other Fabric mod's, so every mcwbridges
# block and item on the client is one id further along than on the server. The gate places a bridge block and
# GIVES the player a bridge item, and the client reads both back by name. The item is the sharp one: an item id off
# by one is a different item, full stop. A block-STATE id off by one usually lands on a neighbouring state of the
# same block — which is how the first negative-control run read the right block name without any remap at all —
# so the block probe reads back the full state, and the vanilla block next to it is the control that must ALWAYS
# match (vanilla ids agree with or without a remap).
#
# The remap has to have actually moved something, and lost nothing: the kernel's own summary line is asserted for
# "N id(s) moved" with N > 0 and "0 entr(ies) lost" — the canary block is client-only, and Forge's loadIds must keep
# it (after the server's ids) rather than drop it. It did drop it on the first run; the kernel now places local-only
# entries after the server's ids itself, which is fabric-api's REMOTE-mode rule.
#
# WHAT THE NEGATIVE CONTROL SHOWED (M14_EXTRA_JVM=-Dforbric.forgeWrapperSync=off, the old behaviour minus the
# crash): the server gave the player an andesite bridge and the client held a MOSSY COBBLESTONE bridge — the item
# one id along — and the placed block read back with the wrong connection state. With the remap: 303 ids moved,
# 0 lost, 34393 block states re-numbered, and both read back as themselves.
#
# Port 25602, not the default — a developer or another agent session may have a server on 25565.
