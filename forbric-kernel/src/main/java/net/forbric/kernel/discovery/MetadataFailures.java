/**
 * The loader manifests that could not be read, per jar and family.
 *
 * <p>One mod's metadata file is that mod's problem. It used to be everyone's: a single
 * {@code versionRange = "[26.2,26.23"} in one jar's {@code neoforge.mods.toml} threw out of discovery, and a
 * 130-jar pack stopped three seconds into the boot with a stack trace and no mod named. Discovery now reads each
 * manifest on its own, records the ones that fail here, and carries on with the rest of the jar and the pack.
 *
 * <p>Recorded is not the same as forgiven. {@link #recordFindings} turns every failure into a
 * {@link CompatibilityFinding}: a jar left with no family that could be read is a confirmed, required loss the
 * player is asked about (or that stops a strict launch), exactly as a mod whose constructor threw. A universal jar
 * that still loads through another family's manifest only gets a note.
 *
 * <p>Static, because about seven passes each make their own {@link ForbricModDiscoverer} during one boot and all
 * of them must agree on which manifests failed.
