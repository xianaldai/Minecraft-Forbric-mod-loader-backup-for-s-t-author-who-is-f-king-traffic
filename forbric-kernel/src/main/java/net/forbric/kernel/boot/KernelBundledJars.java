/**
 * Extracts the jars bundled inside the kernel's own jar that must live on the GAME side.
 *
 * <p>Both of them are here for the same structural reason and neither can be parent-loaded: MixinExtras
 * generates classes (the {@code LocalRef} machinery) that must share a loader with the game classes they touch,
 * and the kernel's own game-side half is pinned {@code ALWAYS_GAME} by {@code DelegationPolicy} precisely so
 * that it can name game types. Carrying them inside the boot jar keeps the kernel ONE file — no launcher
 * argument, no installer step, nothing for a profile to get wrong.
 *
 * <p>The two differ in what their absence MEANS, and that difference is carried as data rather than averaged
 * into one warning. A missing MixinExtras is a degraded run: most of fabric-api stops applying its mixins, and
 * saying so is the most the kernel can do. A missing game-side jar is a BROKEN KERNEL — it means the boot jar
 * was built on a machine with no staged artifacts, so every class the kernel itself will ask for game-side is
 * simply not there. That one names the build command, because the reader can fix it in one line.
