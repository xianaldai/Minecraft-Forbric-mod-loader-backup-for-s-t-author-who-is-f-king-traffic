/**
 * Vanilla method bodies a carrier moved, whole or in pieces, into a method it added under another name with the same
 * descriptor, and which calls and field accesses moved with them — the shipped table {@code carrier-renames.txt}, which
 * CarrierRenameCensusTest re-derives from the staged jars and pins. MixinRetarget's R3 moves an injector's selector
 * only along rows, and only when every anchor it names is one of the calls that moved.
 *
 * <p>A pair {@code method -> renamed} is in the table when: in each listed ecosystem's own jar the class declares
 * {@code method} and not {@code renamed}; the merged base declares both, with the same descriptor and static-ness;
 * {@code renamed} is made of that jar's {@code method} — of the calls and field accesses of whichever of the two makes
 * fewer, at least half and at least two are the other's too — and makes some of them that the merged {@code method}
 * no longer makes; and the merged class still calls {@code renamed}, from {@code method} itself (a call, or the method
 * handle of a lambda it creates) or from another of its methods — or, marked {@link #UNCALLED}, {@code renamed} is
 * private and nothing in its class or its nest calls it. NeoForge's
 * {@code PersistentEntitySectionManager.addEntity} posts its event and calls vanilla's body as
 * {@code addEntityWithoutEvent}; its {@code ServerConfigurationPacketListenerImpl.startConfiguration} first asks the
 * client what it speaks, and {@code handlePong} runs vanilla's body as {@code runConfiguration}. What would make a move
 * a guess is left out: a renamed method made of two of the reference's methods, two of one method's that are copies,
 * and, of several renamed methods of one method, any it does not call itself (the pieces of a split, such as
 * NeoForge's four HUD layers out of {@code Hud.extractPlayerHealth}, are what it dispatches to).
 *
 * <p>Each pair has one row per call or field access that moved: one the reference's {@code method} makes, the merged
 * {@code method} makes less often, and {@code renamed} makes. An anchor that is not among them was not in vanilla's
 * body where the mod looked — on the reference the mod misses too — and a row is no reason to move it. A row also says
 * how often the reference's {@code method} makes its call: where {@code renamed} makes it more often, the carrier added
 * one, and an anchor that binds every match would bind that one too. And each pair is a {@link Kind#RENAME} or a
 * {@link Kind#PIECE}: whether {@code renamed} makes every call and field access of the reference's {@code method}, as
 * often, or only part of them; a piece whose result the merged method returns whenever it is an {@code Either} left is
 * marked {@link Exit#LEFT} ({@link #returnsLefts}).
 *
 * <p>The table exists because the bytes alone were wrong in seven of the 15 moves an audit of R3 over 655 mod jars
 * found. text_styles' {@code Style.withColor(I)} went to {@code withShadowColor(I)}, ViaFabricPlus'
 * {@code checkHotbarKeyPressed} to {@code keyPressed} and its {@code updatingUsingItem} to {@code releaseUsingItem},
 * goldenpotions' {@code CreativeModeTabs.lambda$bootstrap$21} to {@code lambda$bootstrap$24}: each a method of the same
 * shape that happened to carry the anchor and that vanilla itself declares, so no carrier renamed anything. malilib's
 * and trinkets' {@code ItemStack.addDetailsToTooltip} went to {@code addDetailsToTooltipComponents}: NeoForge's renamed
 * body, but nothing in the merged game calls it — NeoForge draws tooltips from its own appenders — so the injection
 * bound, never ran, and read as fitting. That pair is now a row marked {@link #UNCALLED}: the move binds the injector
 * where the body is and says it never runs, as MixinFit and the final-class check report it ({@link #neverRuns}), so
 * malilib's required tooltip hook is a reported loss that marks its row and does not stop a strict launch.
 *
 * <p>The rows are re-checked against the live bytes ({@link #called}, {@link #carries}): a transform that drops the
 * last call to a renamed body leaves nothing to move to, and one that adds a call to an UNCALLED one makes it no longer
 * dead.
