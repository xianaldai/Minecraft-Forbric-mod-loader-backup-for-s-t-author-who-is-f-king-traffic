# M12 gate — a REAL client on a REAL socket to a REAL dedicated server.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Until this gate, twelve gates covered two shapes and neither was multiplayer: eleven booted a
# dedicated server nobody ever connected to, and gate-m9 drove a client through --quickPlaySingleplayer, which
# negotiates over an in-memory connection to the integrated server. Modpacks are played on servers, and the whole
# client/server handshake — the configuration phase, known-pack negotiation, registry and tag sync, the custom
# payload channels every mod registers — ran in no test at all.
#
# That gap had a name. fabric-resource-loader's SynchronizeRegistriesTaskMixin was restored from a years-old pin
# after measuring that nothing regressed; the honest caveat written down at the time was that every gate
# negotiates over memory, so the case the mixin EXISTS for — a remote client and server comparing pack sets — was
# still unexercised. This is that exercise.
#
# Deliberately NOT port 25565. A developer, or another agent session, may have a server on the default port; a
# gate that silently connects to someone else's world would be both wrong and hard to notice.
#
# THIS GATE ARRIVED RED AND EARNED ITS KEEP: four bugs that eleven green gates could not see, because none of them
# ever connected a client over a socket and singleplayer negotiates in memory (no configuration-phase handshake,
# no registry sync, no packet ever encoded). In the order they fell:
#
#  1. The server kicked its own client: "This server requires Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed on your
#     client!" NeoForge's patched ClientConfigurationPacketListenerImpl.handleCustomPayload answers the server's
#     minecraft:register itself and RETURNS, never reaching the superclass where Fabric's dispatch hook lives — so the
#     client declared NeoForge's channels only, and Fabric's ServerConfigurationNetworkAddon treats the FIRST register
#     as the complete declaration (SENT -> RECEIVED -> startConfiguration -> configureClient -> canSend false -> kick).
#     Fix: CommonNetworkInteropInjector splices the super call in BEFORE NeoForge's reply, so Fabric declares first.
#  2. The server could not ENCODE neoforge:recipe_content (ClassCastException to DiscardedPayload): NeoForge's own
#     payload types had never registered on ANY dedicated server the kernel booted — NetworkRegistry.setup() fans
#     RegisterPayloadHandlersEvent out over ModList, and the baseline container was only put there on the client.
#     Fix: publishModBusDelivery runs on both sides; the setup line now reports what actually registered.
#  3. ClientNetworkRegistry.setup() ran on the server too and, once NeoForge's payloads existed, correctly failed
#     "missing client-side handlers". Fix: client-only, as genuine NeoForge has it.
#  4. The client died applying NeoForge's frozen-registry snapshot: NullPointerException "holder is null" in
#     MappedRegistry.registerIdMapping. Seventeen builtin registries are MinecraftForge NamespacedWrappers whose
#     inherited MappedRegistry fields stay empty; NeoForge remaps through exactly those fields. Fix:
#     RegistrySyncParityInjector gives the wrapper NeoForge's clear/registerIdMapping contract and applies the staged
#     ids through Forge's own GameData.injectSnapshot (KernelForgeWrapperSync).
#
# Each is pinned below by an assertion that fails on the log line it used to produce. Both ends Forbric is what this
# gate exercises; a Forbric client against a PURE Fabric server is gate-m14's job, and the wrappers follow that
# server's ids there too.
