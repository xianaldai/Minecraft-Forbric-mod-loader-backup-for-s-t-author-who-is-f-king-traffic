# M16 gate — MinecraftForge's own login/configuration handshake, over a socket.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. m15 proved a Forge mod's PLAY-phase packets cross the wire. Everything that happens BEFORE that
# — Forge telling each end what the other is running, and pushing the server's per-world SERVER configs to the
# client — is a separate pipeline, and three of its links lost the byte-merge to NeoForge: the client never
# installed Forge's per-connection packet handler (Connection.channelActive lost the activation call), the server
# never posted Forge's gather event (its configuration body is NeoForge's), and the surviving task dispatch used
# the vanilla overload that Forge's own tasks refuse. So on Forbric every Forge mod saw a vanilla peer with an
# empty mod list, and a server config a mod set in its world never reached the client.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES. The gate writes a NON-DEFAULT value into the server's world config before the server boots.
# The client ships the same mod with the same default. If the client ends up reading the server's value, Forge's
# configuration-phase sync ran end to end; if the handshake is off, it reads its own default — which is exactly
# what the negative control (-Dforbric.forgeHandshake=off) asserts.
#
# Port 25604, not the default — a developer or another agent session may have a server on 25565.
