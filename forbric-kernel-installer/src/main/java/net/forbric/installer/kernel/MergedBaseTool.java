/**
 * Byte-merges vanilla, Forge-patched and NeoForge-patched Minecraft into the one base a Forbric instance runs on,
 * and patches the cross-runtime interop gaps that merge opens up.
 *
 * <p>Both steps live in {@code forbric-merge-tools.jar}, which rides inside the installer as a resource and is
 * unpacked next to the build. Three reasons it is a separate jar run as a subprocess rather than code called
 * in-process:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The merge wants a 4 GB heap ({@code -Xmx4g}, 30,471 output entries and ~17,680 diamond-default
 *       resolutions). A process cannot raise its own maximum heap after it starts, so the installer would have to
 *       have been launched with the right one — and it is launched by a double-click.</li>
 *   <li>The tools need ASM. Keeping it in its own jar preserves the installer's own rule that it carries
 *       Forbric's jars and nothing else, instead of quietly growing a dependency.</li>
 *   <li>A single-entry {@code -cp} is the one classpath form with nothing to get wrong about {@code ;} versus
 *       {@code :}. The shell script this replaces built its classpath with {@code paste -sd:}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The interop step is not optional, and the installer skipped it until now. {@code build-merged-base.sh}
 * produces {@code forge-runtime-interop.jar} and every dev launch prefers it, but the installed profile was
 * staging the raw {@code forge-runtime.jar} — so an installed instance ran without the bridge method
 * {@code NamespacedWrapper$3.contents()}, which the merge makes abstract on {@code Registry$PendingTags} by
 * taking NeoForge's shape. The first NeoForge call down that path is an {@code AbstractMethodError}, and it is
 * far enough from the cause to be expensive.
