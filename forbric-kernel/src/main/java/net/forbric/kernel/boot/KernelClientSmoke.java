/**
 * Drives an unattended client run so a gate can assert on it: enter a world, live in it, leave cleanly, exit.
 *
 * <p>Every client fix in this kernel has been verified by launching the game and reading the log by hand, which
 * means none of them is protected against the next change. The obstacle is that a client does not end on its own
 * — quick-play gets it into a world, and then it sits there. This is the missing half: a tick hook that counts
 * ticks spent actually in a world, then asks the game to disconnect and stop, so a gate script can wait for a
 * definite outcome instead of a timeout.
 *
 * <p>Three markers, in order, and the gate asserts all three because each rules out a different failure. Joining
 * says the world loaded; surviving READY_TICKS says it did not die on the first tick of real simulation, which is
 * where registry and attribute problems land; the clean disconnect says teardown works and — because the launcher
 * deliberately does not kill the process afterwards — leaves vanilla's own shutdown watchdog free to catch a
 * leaked non-daemon thread.
 *
 * <p>Off unless {@code -Dforbric.clientSmoke=true}. Everything is reached reflectively and every failure is
 * swallowed: a diagnostic must never be able to break the thing it is measuring.
