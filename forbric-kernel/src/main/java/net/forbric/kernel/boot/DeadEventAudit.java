/**
 * Names the MinecraftForge game events that are still DEAD on the merged base, and which mod is listening for
 * one.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every failure in this class of bug looks the same from the outside: the mod loads, reports nothing wrong,
 * registers its listener, and the listener never runs. There is no exception, no warning, and nothing in any log
 * connects the missing behaviour to the missing hook. The kernel has paid for that shape repeatedly — a Forge
 * mod's commands not existing, its key bindings doing nothing, its protection rules silently not applying — and
 * each time the diagnosis came from reading the merged base's bytecode by hand, months later.
 *
 * <p>So the inventory is turned around: instead of only recording what IS bridged, this records what is known to
 * be dead and not yet bridged, and says so once per boot, naming the event. It is a diagnosis printed before the
 * symptom rather than after it.
 *
 * <h2>How the list was established, and how to re-establish it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each entry is a call site read out of the merged jar with {@code javap -p -c}, counting which family's hook
 * survived at it. For example {@code ServerPlayerGameMode} contains
 * {@code net/neoforged/neoforge/common/CommonHooks.fireBlockBreak}, {@code .onRightClickBlock},
 * {@code .onLeftClickBlock} and {@code .onItemRightClick} — and ZERO references to any
 * {@code net/minecraftforge/} hook. {@code ServerGamePacketListenerImpl} has NeoForge's
 * {@code getServerChatSubmittedDecorator} and no MinecraftForge chat hook; {@code Level} has NeoForge's
 * {@code onNeighborNotify}; {@code LivingEntity} has NeoForge's {@code onLivingFall}.
 *
 * <p>It is DATA, deliberately, not a scan: scanning a 30MB merged jar for hook references on every boot would
 * cost more than it is worth, and the answer only changes when the merged base is rebuilt. When it is rebuilt,
 * re-run the survey and update this map — the audit itself will not notice a base that grew a hook back, it will
 * only over-report, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * <p>Anything the kernel does bridge is subtracted live from {@link EventBridges#installed()}, so an entry does
 * not have to be deleted here the day a bridge for it lands.
