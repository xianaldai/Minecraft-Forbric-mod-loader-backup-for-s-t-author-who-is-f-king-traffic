 * renamed or dropped meets nothing and says nothing, and the mod that needed the access dies later on an
 * {@code IllegalAccessError} that names neither the directive nor the mod. Each transformer records such a
 * directive here as it finishes the class, with the jar the directive came from; {@link #report} says how many,
 * names each, and marks the owning jar's rows DEGRADED. A carrier's own directive is named but marks nothing.
 *
 * <p>Only a class that was actually transformed can have unmatched directives: a directive whose class never
 * loaded on this side is not counted, so a client-only entry costs a dedicated server nothing.
