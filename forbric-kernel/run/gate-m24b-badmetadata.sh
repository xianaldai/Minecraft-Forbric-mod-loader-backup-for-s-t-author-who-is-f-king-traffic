# M24b unreadable-metadata gate — one jar's broken manifest costs that jar, and is named.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. EntityCount-multiloader-0.6.1-26.2.jar ships versionRange = "[26.2,26.23" in its
# neoforge.mods.toml. In a 130-jar pack (random100, 2026-09-29) that one string stopped the boot three seconds in,
# with an IllegalArgumentException out of discovery and no mod named: discovery threw out of the whole jar, and
# the Forge-family loop caught only IOException. gate-m24 proves a mod that fails in its ENTRYPOINT stays one
# mod's failure; nothing proved the same for a mod that fails before it has an entrypoint at all.
#
# Staged next to two healthy canaries:
#   forbricbadmetaneo.jar   — its only manifest cannot be read. FML refuses it; Forbric must not load it, must name
#                             it as a mod that did not load, and must let the others load.
#   forbricbadmetamulti.jar — a universal jar: its neoforge.mods.toml cannot be read, its fabric.mod.json can.
#                             Native Fabric loads it, so Forbric must too, as Fabric, with only a note.
# Strict policy must stop the same pack before Done. A final clean control must start under strict.
