# M13 gate — a Forbric client judged by a real anti-cheat on a real Paper server.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. gate-m12 proved a Forbric client can join a Forbric server; it says nothing about what that
# client looks like to a server that is WATCHING it. Anti-cheats ban on behaviour — the movement and combat
# packets a client emits — and the merged base those packets come out of is three patch sets byte-merged into one
# jar (1045 resolved conflicts, plus the kernel's post-merge fixups). Any place that merge nudged movement physics
# off vanilla would read to a prediction-based anti-cheat as "this player moves wrong", and nothing measured that.
#
# This gate does. It boots Paper 26.2 with GrimAC (the strictest open-source prediction anti-cheat, sensitised so
# that EVERY violation prints — see the staging step), connects a Forbric client, and drives it through the
# movement drill in KernelClientSmoke: walk, sprint, sprint-jump, turn, strafe, backpedal, sneak, mine, place
# blocks, swim. Every input goes through the same path a keyboard would, so the packets are the real game's.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL. The drill ends with one impossible move (six blocks in a tick). A run with zero flags proves
# nothing on its own — the anti-cheat may not be watching — so this gate demands SILENCE before that move and
# at least one flag AFTER it. Both halves are asserted; neither is meaningful alone. The boundary is a marker
# this gate writes INTO the server's own log (`say FORBRIC-CONTROL`) when the drill announces the move, three
# seconds before it makes it: on the first run the flag was filed on the wrong side because Grim printed it
# ~50 ms after the move and a polled line count was a second late. The offset it printed — 5.999 blocks — was
# the control itself, and the whole legitimate drill was silent.
#
# Also the first gate to put a Forbric client on a NON-Forbric server (Paper speaks the vanilla protocol): the
# NeoForge and Fabric halves of the client must both behave as they do against vanilla, i.e. stay quiet.
#
# Port 25601, not the default — a developer or another agent session may have a server on 25565.
