/**
 * If the staged game artifacts are here, the tests that read them have to actually be reading them.
 *
 * <h2>Why a green suite has not meant much</h2>
 *
 * <p>About a third of the assertions in this project are about real bytecode — whether a carrier still declares
 * a method the kernel splices at, whether a vanilla field's descriptor survived the merge, whether a repair's
 * anchor is still there. Every one of them is guarded by an {@code assumeTrue} on a staged jar, because those
 * jars embed Mojang/Forge/NeoForge code and are built on the user's own machine rather than checked in.
 *
 * <p>JUnit reports an assumption as SKIPPED, not failed. So on a machine without the artifacts the suite says
 * green while a third of it never ran, and the CI job — which deliberately has no artifacts, to prove a clean
 * clone still builds — has never executed a single one of those assertions. That is the right call for CI and a
 * trap everywhere else: the one run that matters is the one on the machine that HAS the jars, and nothing was
 * checking that it used them.
 *
 * <p>So this asserts the conditional: artifacts absent, say so and pass; artifacts present, and a floor of
 * real-bytecode tests must have executed. It is the cheapest thing that makes "910 tests, 0 failures" mean what
 * a reader takes it to mean.
