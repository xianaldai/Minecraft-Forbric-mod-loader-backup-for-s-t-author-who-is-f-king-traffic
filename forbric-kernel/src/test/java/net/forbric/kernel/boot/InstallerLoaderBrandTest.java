/**
 * Pins the loader coordinate the installer writes into the version profile to the API level the kernel actually
 * implements.
 *
 * <p>The installer is a separate module that does not compile against the kernel — it builds the kernel jar as a
 * subprocess — so the coordinate over there is a string literal and nothing relates it to
 * {@link KernelFabricEcosystem#FABRIC_LOADER_API_LEVEL}. Raising the API level without raising the profile would
 * leave every freshly installed instance telling its launcher a version the kernel no longer provides, and no
 * build anywhere would notice.
 *
 * <p>Read as SOURCE TEXT on purpose. A test that called the installer would need it on the classpath, which is
 * the dependency this arrangement exists to avoid.
