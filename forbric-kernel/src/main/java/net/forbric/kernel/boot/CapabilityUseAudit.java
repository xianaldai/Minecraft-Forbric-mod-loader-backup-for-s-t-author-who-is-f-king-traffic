/**
 * Names the mods that ask for a capability system the merged game does not have.
 *
 * <h2>What is missing, and why this is a warning rather than a repair</h2>
 *
 * <p>Traditional MinecraftForge attaches capabilities — item handlers, fluid tanks, energy storage — to entities,
 * block entities and levels through a provider on a common superclass. The merge puts those three root types
 * under NeoForge's attachment system instead, so that superclass and its storage are gone. A mod calling
 * {@code getCapability} therefore has nothing to call it on.
 *
 * <p>Attaching capabilities for real means giving those root types a provider, which is a change to how the
 * merge builds them, not something a transformer can add afterwards. Until then the honest thing is to say which
 * mods are affected, because the failure otherwise arrives as a missing-method error from inside the mod, on a
 * line the player cannot connect to anything.
 *
 * <p>Detected by looking for the package name in the raw class bytes, where a type it names appears verbatim in
 * the constant pool. That makes a "no" final rather than a guess, and it costs one pass over bytes the
 * subscriber scan is already reading.
