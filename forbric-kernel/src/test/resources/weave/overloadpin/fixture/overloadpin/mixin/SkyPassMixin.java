/**
 * Written the way a mod writes it against vanilla, where {@code lambda$render$0} is unique: name only, and a handler
 * shaped for vanilla's {@code (String, StringBuilder)}. On the merged class that shape was pruned, and the surviving
 * {@code (StringBuilder, String, String)} has two Strings, so MixinHandlerShim cannot say which one to hand over and
 * declines. Mixin then rejects the descriptor; nothing can make this bind, and the only question left is whether the
