/**
 * Injector targets the mod's own platform lacks as well as the merged base: the misses native Mixin drops without a
 * word, and which are therefore nothing the merge cost the mod.
 *
 * <p>Not Enough Crashes 4.4.9 for 26.2 is the worked case. Its {@code MixinTileEntity} injects into
 * {@code BlockEntity.populateCrashReport} — the Yarn name of what 26.2 calls {@code fillCrashReportCategory}, in a
 * mod built from Yarn sources for an unobfuscated game. Neither vanilla nor the merged base has that method.
 * {@link MixinFit} found no anchor, called the mixin UNFIT, and the adapter left it out as a CONFIRMED loss the
 * config's {@code required: true} made required — so the default STRICT policy stopped a server that native Fabric
 * Loader 0.19.5 starts with the same jar.
 *
 * <h2>What native Mixin does with an injector whose selector matches nothing</h2>
 *
 * <p>Read from sponge-mixin 0.17.3 (the kernel's, and native NeoForge 26.2.0.88's), 0.17.4 (Fabric Loader 0.19.5's)
 * and upstream Mixin 0.8.7 (MinecraftForge 26.2-65.0.1's), which agree here. {@code InjectionInfo.parseRequirements}
 * takes the injector's own {@code require} when it is 0 or more, else — for an injector in no {@code @Group} — the
 * config's {@code injectors.defaultRequire}, which is 0 unless the config says otherwise.
 * {@code TargetSelectors.validate} then throws only when that count is above 0 ("Critical injection failure: … could
 * not find any targets matching …"), or when {@code mixin.debug.countInjections} (or {@code mixin.debug}) is on and
 * {@code expect}, default 1, is above 0. Otherwise nothing is said: {@code InjectionInfo.isValid()} is false,
 * {@code MixinTargetContext.prepareInjections} skips the injector, and the rest of the mixin — its fields, their
 * initializers, its other methods, its interfaces, the handler itself — is merged as usual. A {@code @Group} counts
 * its members together and needs at least one injection, so a grouped injector is never silently empty. The config's
 * own {@code required} flag only decides whether one of those errors is fatal; it makes no injector mandatory.
 * Measured on native Fabric 0.19.5 with Not Enough Crashes alone and {@code -Dmixin.debug.export=true}: the server
 * reaches Done, Mixin logs nothing about the injector, and the woven {@code BlockEntity} carries {@code noNBT}, its
 * constructor initializer, the lambda and the merged handler, with no call to the handler anywhere.
 *
 * <p>Only a selector that is a plain method name, optionally with a descriptor and with the target itself as its
 * owner, is a name lookup that silently finds nothing ({@link #plainSelector}). The rest of the grammar means
 * something else: a leading {@code @} is a registered dynamic selector (MixinSquared's {@code @MixinSquared:Handler}
 * resolves to another mixin's merged handler), a trailing {@code +} or {@code {n,}} is a quantifier whose minimum
 * {@code TargetSelectors.findRootTargets} enforces whatever {@code require} says, a dotted name splits into an owner
 * and a name, and a descriptor that is not one fails validation. Those are never answered here.
 *
 * <h2>Whose native: the mod's own platform</h2>
 *
 * <p>A Fabric mod's native game is vanilla 26.2. A MinecraftForge or NeoForge mod's is its own platform's patched
 * game, which declares methods vanilla does not — {@code KeyMapping.getKeyModifier()}, {@code AxeItem.canPerformAction},
 * NeoForge's {@code EnderDragon.getParts()} — and some of those the merge dropped or retyped. For such a mod "vanilla
 * lacks it too" proves nothing: natively the injector applies, and here it cannot, which is the merge's loss. So the
 * question is asked of the owning mod's platform ({@link MixinConfigOwners#ecosystemOf}), and a config no single mod
 * claims is not asked at all. The patched jars are the whole of what those platforms declare in vanilla's packages:
 * neither runtime ships a class there, and their own transformers add no method there (MinecraftForge 65.0.1's
 * coremods are one redirect list, {@code finalize_spawn_targets.json}; NeoForge 26.2.0.88's coremods jar holds
 * {@code MethodRedirector}, {@code ReplaceFieldWithGetterAccess} and {@code ReplaceFieldComparisonWithInstanceOf},
 * which rewrite instructions only).
 *
 * <h2>Which misses the platform shares</h2>
 *
 * <p>The kernel sees only the merged base at run time, and none of the three platform jars is shipped with it. What is
 * shipped is the difference: {@value #TABLE}, which NativeOnlyMethodsCensusTest re-derives from vanilla 26.2's own jar,
 * the staged MinecraftForge and NeoForge patched jars and the staged merged base, and pins. Measured, every class the
 * three declare in vanilla's packages is in the merged base, and only 565 of vanilla's methods, 424 of
 * MinecraftForge's and 14 of NeoForge's are not (most of them lambdas and anonymous classes the merge renumbered), so a
 * platform's declared methods are the merged class's own minus what the merge added, plus that platform's rows for
 * that class. A method the merged class does not declare and no row of the platform names is a method the platform
 * does not declare either.
 *
 * <p>"The merged class's own" means the merged base's RAW bytes, before the kernel's transform chain: the chain
 * removes some methods (orphaned lambda twins, interface-default shadowing stubs), and a method only the chain took
 * away may well be the platform's — the census never saw that removal. So a method the raw class still declares is
 * never called absent; the miss stays the merge's, as before.
 *
 * <p>The rows hold only for the merged base they were derived from, and a base that lost a method the staged one kept
 * would have no row for it — the direction that hides a loss. So the table carries that base's members digest
 * ({@link #membersDigest}: every class in vanilla's packages with its methods' names and descriptors, bodies left out,
 * so a rebuild that changes only code still matches), and nothing is answered for a class served by a jar whose digest
 * differs, or by no jar the kernel can read; such a miss counts as the merge's, as before, and one warning names the
 * mismatch.
 *
 * <p>Only classes in vanilla's own packages are asked, and only those the raw view can see and the table does not list
 * as the merged base's alone for that platform (a class the platform lacks fails natively for a different reason:
 * Mixin cannot find the target and skips the whole mixin). Another mod's class is never asked: {@link MixinFit} judges
 * those as foreign.
 *
 * <h2>Minecraft's own libraries</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code com/mojang/} is also where Minecraft's libraries live — brigadier, DataFixerUpper, authlib and five more —
 * and the kernel loads those from their own jars, beside the merged base, so a mod can mixin into them as it can
 * natively. Their raw bytes are what every platform loads: vanilla 26.2 lists them in its version JSON, and
 * MinecraftForge 65.0.1's and NeoForge 26.2.0.88's launcher profiles both inherit that list and add no
 * {@code com.mojang} library (measured on their installers), and no platform jar or merged base ships one of their
 * classes. So the table also records each of those jars' members digest ({@code library} lines, re-derived from the
 * version JSON), and a class served by one of exactly those jars is answered from its raw bytes, as the merged base's
 * classes are. A library jar of another version, or a mod's own copy, has another digest and is not answered for.
 *
 * <h2>Whose native: the version the mod asks for</h2>
 *
 * <p>The rows describe one game per platform: vanilla 26.2, MinecraftForge 65.0.1's patched 26.2 and NeoForge
 * 26.2.0.88's, which the table's {@code platform} lines record ({@code minecraft=}, {@code forge=}, {@code neoforge=}).
 * A mod whose mandatory {@code minecraft} range, or {@code forge}/{@code neoforge} range for its platform, excludes that
 * version is not native to that game: its own loader would refuse it there, and the newer game it was built for may
 * well declare the method this one lacks. Such a mod is not answered for — the miss is the merge's, as before — and
 * one line names the requirement. Nor is a mod whose declared requirements the kernel cannot see (the config's owner
 * has no metadata in {@link net.forbric.api.ModPresence}), or whose range cannot be read: being asked is the claim that
 * would hide a loss, so it needs a requirement that is shown to admit the table's game.
 *
 * <p>What this changes is only the judgement. Such an injector is neither a resolved nor a missing anchor; the mixin
 * is judged on the rest, and when nothing else is missing it goes to Mixin whole, which drops the injector exactly as
 * native does. {@link FinalMixinApplications} then reads the injector's original minimum, 0, and finds nothing to
 * report. {@code -Dforbric.mixinFit.nativeAbsent=off} counts every such target as a miss again, as before.
