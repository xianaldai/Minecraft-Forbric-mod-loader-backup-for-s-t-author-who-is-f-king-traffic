/**
 * Defines every class the kernel's own jar carries while that jar is known to be readable.
 *
 * <h2>Why</h2>
 *
 * <p>The boot side is loaded from the kernel jar by the JVM's class-path loader, and that loader reads a class out of
 * the jar the first time something needs it. Much of the boot side is first needed long after boot, from bytecode the
 * kernel splices into the game: MinecraftForge's fluid rules reach {@code ForgeRuntimeInterop} at the first lava or
 * water placement that asks them, and NeoForge's {@code RegistryManager.revertToFrozen} reaches
 * {@code KernelRegistryRevert} when a player leaves a world. If the jar has been replaced on disk in between (a
 * developer redeploying mid-session), or sits on a volume that went away, that first use reads a file that no longer
 * holds the class: gate M22 measured both — a server crash report ("Exception ticking world",
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError: net/forbric/kernel/interop/ForgeRuntimeInterop}) when the first lava flow came after
 * the jar was truncated, and a {@code NoClassDefFoundError} for {@code KernelRegistryRevert} on every disconnect.
 *
 * <p>The exit hook used to be the only class resolved early for this reason (see {@code KernelBoot}). Every spliced
 * hook has the same exposure, and so does every class those hooks reach in turn, so naming them one at a time would
 * be a list that goes stale the next time a repair calls into the boot side. Defining the whole jar is the complete
 * answer and it is cheap: 703 classes in about 65 ms on a cold JVM, most of which boot loads anyway.
 *
 * <p>Defining, not initializing: defining is the step that reads the jar, and a static initializer run at boot instead
 * of at first use would be a behaviour change for every class here. Initialization, linking and lambda spinning need
 * nothing from the file once the class is defined.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.bootJarPreload=off} leaves the jar to be read lazily, as before.
