/**
 * A whole-artifact detector for a vanilla field whose vanilla DESCRIPTOR the merged base no longer offers.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not {@link MergedBaseNoUnwrittenDuplicateFieldTest}</h2>
 *
 * <p>That test covers the case where the merge keeps BOTH declarations and only one is written — the field is
 * there, and it is null. This is the neighbouring case and the more damaging one: when one ecosystem RE-TYPES a
 * vanilla field and the merge keeps only its declaration, vanilla's {@code (name, descriptor)} pair stops
 * existing. Nothing is null, because there is nothing. A mod compiled against vanilla gets
 * {@code NoSuchFieldError} at its {@code GETFIELD}/{@code PUTFIELD}, or — if it reaches the field through Mixin —
 * an {@code @Accessor} that cannot bind, which by default is a warning and a feature silently gone. The duplicate
 * test is blind to it by construction: the name is not duplicated.
 *
 * <p>It has cost a boot. {@code ChunkGenerator.featuresPerStep} became MinecraftForge's {@code ClearableLazy},
 * and fabric-api's biome API writes that field directly with vanilla's descriptor — so a dedicated server with
 * any Fabric biome modification installed did not start. That one is repaired now, which is why it is not in the
 * list below; the list is what is still true.
 *
 * <h2>Why a pinned list rather than zero</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the answer today is not zero and pretending otherwise would mean deleting the test the first time it
 * went red. Each entry below is a real, still-unrepaired drift with the consequence stated, so the set is a
 * ledger rather than a suppression: a NEW drift fails this test, and repairing one of these fails it too, which
 * is the right time to delete its line.
 *
 * <p>The comparison is made AFTER the kernel's compat transformer has run, because that is what the game sees.
