/**
 * {@code CreateKeyboardMixinAdapter} through the real weave, on a CLIENT run: Create Fly's key hooks, written for
 * vanilla's keyPress (the release at its sixth return, the press at its TAIL), on a merged keyPress where NeoForge
 * joined every exit into one {@code ClientHooks.onKeyInput} call.
 *
 * <p>The probe presses, repeats and releases one key and reports who heard each, in order. Adapted, the mod hears the
 * press and the repeat as presses after NeoForge's event and the release as a release just before it — once each,
 * because the adapter guards both handlers by the action they were written for. With
 * {@code -Dforbric.createKeyboardMixin=off} the release hook has no sixth return to bind to, so it is the mod's
 * required loss, and the TAIL hook reports the release as one more press.
