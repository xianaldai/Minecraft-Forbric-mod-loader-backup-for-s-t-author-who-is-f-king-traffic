# M29 — MinecraftForge's capability system on the merged base: attach through AttachCapabilitiesEvent, read back
# through getCapability on block entities / entities / levels / chunks / item stacks, invalidate on removal, persist
# under "ForgeCaps", and initialise ForgeCapabilities at all (its tokens need Forge's launch plugin).
# Boot 1 (shim ON) asserts nine canary lines + the kernel's composition lines and the absence of every error
# signature; boot 2 (-Dforbric.forgeCapabilities=off) is the RED demonstration and the attribution proof: the
# attached-handler line is absent and load-report.txt names forbriclive DEGRADED. The switch turns off DISPATCH only:
# the merged base requires Entity/BlockEntity/Level composed (required-ancestor-compositions.tsv), so boot 2 also
# asserts the roots still get the (inert) composition and the loader never refuses to define one.
# RED control for boot 1: M29_EXTRA_JVM='-Dforbric.forgeCapabilities=off' (every CAPS line goes red).
# GATE-PARALLEL: rundirs=server-forgecaps mem=1500
