/**
 * The dialog, as a separate process's {@code main}.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a separate process.</b> On macOS the game JVM is started with {@code -XstartOnFirstThread} (see
 * {@code run/launch-kernel-client.sh}), which GLFW requires and which AWT cannot coexist with: both want thread
 * one.
 *
 * <p>Fabric Loader forks there too, and it is worth being exact about what it keys off, because the obvious
 * reading is wrong. With Minecraft's game provider registered it never inspects the environment at all:
 * {@code MinecraftGameProvider.hasAwtSupport()} is {@code !LoaderUtil.hasMacOs()} and nothing more
 * ({@code invokestatic hasMacOs / ifne 10 / iconst_1 ... iconst_0 / ireturn}), so the decision is
 * {@code os.name} alone. Its scan for an environment key beginning {@code JAVA_STARTED_ON_FIRST_THREAD_} lives
 * in {@code LoaderUtil.hasAwtSupport()}, which {@code FabricGuiEntry.open} reaches only while no provider has
 * been established yet. That environment variable is real — measured here, a JVM started with the flag has
 * {@code JAVA_STARTED_ON_FIRST_THREAD_<pid>} and one started without it does not — it is simply not the trigger
 * on the path that matters. The technique is Fabric's either way, read out of the bytecode rather than copied.
 *
 * <p>Forbric forks ALWAYS, on every platform, rather than only where it must. A dialog costs a JVM start only on
 * the boots that have something to report, which are rare, and in exchange there is ONE code path instead of two.
 * The alternative — in-process where it is safe, forked where it is not — is the shape that has to be right on
 * three operating systems and is only ever exercised on whichever one the author had.
 *
 * <p>The one AWT class the game's own process touches is {@code GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()}, in
 * {@link DependencyDialog}'s guard. Measured on a JVM started with {@code -XstartOnFirstThread}: it returns in
 * about 12ms and starts no {@code AWT-} thread, so the guard cannot be the thing that breaks the window it
 * guards. That is a measurement of that one call, not a claim that AWT is never loaded.
 *
 * <p>Exit code IS the answer: {@code 0} continue, {@code 1} quit. Anything else the parent reads as continue,
 * because a dialog that fails must not be able to stop a launch that would otherwise have worked. The crash-suspects
 * offer ({@code --isolation}) adds {@code 2}, start without the suspects; any other answer there, a closed window
 * included, starts the game with every mod, which is what would have happened without the offer. The confirmation
 * ({@code --compatibility}) is the fail-closed one: {@code 0} is the only consent, {@code 4} the player's refusal or a
 * closed window, and anything else -- {@code 3} for a window that could not be shown, or the {@code java} launcher's
 * own {@code 1} when it could not start the child -- nobody having answered, which the parent hands to the game.
 *
 * <h2>What the player is shown</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three layers, in the order a player needs them:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>What is wrong</b>, in their own language and in their own words — which mod, and what it wanted.
 *       {@link DialogLang} holds the words.</li>
 *   <li><b>What might fix it.</b> A warning that does not say what to do next leaves the reader with nothing but
 *       the feeling that something is broken. Every suggestion here is derived from what the kernel actually
 *       measured — the required id, the declared range, the version that is installed, the ecosystem the
 *       dependent belongs to — and is worded as a possibility, because that is all any of it is.</li>
 *   <li><b>The technical detail</b>, behind {@code Show details} and hidden by default. Mixin class names,
 *       unresolved anchors and version ranges are what a mod author or a bug report needs, and they are the
 *       reason the previous version of this dialog opened as a wall of text that a player would close without
 *       reading.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Headless</h2>
 *
 * <p>EVERY line that touches a window — building the components, sizing against the screen, creating the dialog,
 * showing it — is inside one try that answers {@link #CONTINUE}. Nothing about this is decoration: an uncaught
 * {@code HeadlessException} leaves the JVM with exit code 1, the parent reads 1 as {@link #QUIT}, and a client
 * with no display would quit the game on the player's behalf — an inversion of the exact policy this whole
 * feature exists to uphold.
