/**
 * Pins the reflective contract {@link KernelModContainerFactory} depends on, against the real NeoForge carrier.
 *
 * <p>That factory is 371 lines of {@code Class.forName}, a {@code Proxy}, {@code UnsafeHacks} field-poking and
 * ASM generation, and it has NOT ONE warn or error path. Every name in it is a string the compiler never sees:
 * four class names, five field names on two classes, and two methods on Forge's {@code UnsafeHacks}. If a carrier
 * upgrade renames any of them the factory does not fail loudly — it throws deep inside mod construction, or
 * silently builds a container with a null where a mod expects its event bus.
 *
 * <p>The carrier has already been re-pinned once (NeoForge .7-beta to .38-beta), so "a field moved" is a live
 * upgrade hazard rather than a hypothetical. These assertions are the cheap early warning: they read the staged
 * jar directly, so they go red at build time instead of during someone's world load.
