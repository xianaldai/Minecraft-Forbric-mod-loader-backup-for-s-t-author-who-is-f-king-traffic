/**
 * What each ecosystem's mods are, as seen from the OTHER ecosystems.
 *
 * <p>On a normal instance "is mod X installed" has one answer because there is one loader. Here there are three,
 * and each keeps its own list: NeoForge's {@code LoadingModList} and {@code ModList}, MinecraftForge's
 * {@code ModList}, and {@code FabricLoader}'s containers. A mod that asks its own loader therefore learns only
 * about mods from its own family — so a NeoForge mod running next to a Fabric Sodium is told Sodium is absent.
 *
 * <p><b>Why that is not cosmetic.</b> The overwhelming use of that question is a COMPATIBILITY BRANCH: "if Sodium
 * is here, render through Sodium's pipeline; otherwise render through vanilla's". Answer it wrongly and the mod
 * takes the vanilla branch while Sodium really has replaced the pipeline, so its work goes somewhere nothing
 * draws. Nothing throws, nothing logs, and the feature is simply invisible — Physics Mod's block debris and
 * ragdolls were exactly this: present, loaded, mixins applied, drawing into a path Sodium no longer runs.
 *
 * <p>This registry is the single answer all three lists are seeded from or fall back to. It is PRESENCE ONLY:
 * declaring a Fabric mod here does not give it a NeoForge container, an event bus or a config, and does not put
 * it in either family's <em>loading</em> list (which is what a multiplayer handshake announces). It states the
 * one thing that is unambiguously true — that mod is running in this instance, at this version.
 *
 * <p>Publishing is done by whoever computed a list, once, during boot; readers are the seeders, the Fabric
 * registration, and the {@code isLoaded} fallback the transform chain injects. Everything degrades to "not
 * present", which is the pre-registry behaviour, if a publish never happens.
 *
 * <h2>Why this lives in {@code net.forbric.api}</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is the first domain where the three compatibility layers align to a Forbric-owned answer rather than to
 * each other, so it is the first one to move out of {@code net.forbric.kernel.boot}. The move is what makes that
 * real rather than nominal: {@code ForeignModPresenceInjector} rewrites both families' {@code ModList.isLoaded}
 * to call {@code net/forbric/api/ModPresence.isLoaded}, so the bytecode crossing from game code into the kernel
 * now lands on an API type instead of a boot-side internal.
 *
 * <p><b>Presence only, still.</b> {@code getModContainerById} is deliberately left alone. There genuinely is no
 * NeoForge container for a Fabric mod, and inventing one would hand a caller a container with no event bus and no
 * config where it expects a real one. The hub answers the question that has one true answer, and declines the one
 * that does not — which is the shape every later domain should copy. The one place a Fabric mod does get a bus-less
 * container is scoped to a class that has just enumerated it out of {@code ModList} for its declarations and looks it
 * up again by id ({@code DeclarationReaderModListInjector}); nowhere else.
