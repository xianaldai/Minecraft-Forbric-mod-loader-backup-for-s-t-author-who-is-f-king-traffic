/**
 * The anchor books against the real merged base, and against a copy of it with the anchor taken away.
 *
 * <p>The second half is the point. Asserting that a repair applies today proves only that today is fine; the
 * failure this whole mechanism exists for is the one that arrives with a carrier upgrade, months from now, and
 * is silent. So the upgrade is simulated here: every {@code NEW net/minecraft/client/Options} in
 * {@code Minecraft.<init>} is rewritten to {@code NEW java/lang/Object}, which is exactly the shape of "Mojang
 * moved Options out of the constructor", and the audit has to notice.
 *
 * <p>No fixture file is needed for that, and deliberately so. A checked-in copy of a mutated class would rot
 * against the very carrier bumps it is meant to model.
