/**
 * Re-emits "this player started/stopped tracking this entity", which the byte merge left NeoForge-only.
 *
 * <h2>How this one was chosen</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not by reading a log. {@code hook-worklist.sh} joins the hooks the merged base no longer calls to the mods
 * whose constant pools name the events those hooks post, and on the 97-jar pack this is one of seven with a
 * named waiter and no bridge: {@code collective} subscribes to {@code PlayerEvent$StartTracking}, and
 * {@code ForgeEventFactory.onStartEntityTracking} has no call site anywhere in the merged base. NeoForge's
 * counterpart is posted and alive, so a bridge has something to listen to — which is what made this one
 * buildable and three of the seven not.
 *
 * <h2>Why both halves, when only one has a waiter</h2>
 *
 * <p>Tracking is a pair. A mod told that a player started tracking an entity and never told that it stopped
 * accumulates per-viewer state for entities that are gone — the failure is a leak that grows with play time,
 * which is worse than the silence it replaces and would be blamed on the mod. {@code onStopEntityTracking} is
 * equally uncalled on the merged base and NeoForge posts its {@code StopTracking} too, so bridging one without
 * the other would be choosing to build that leak.
 *
 * <h2>Observers, not vetoes</h2>
 *
 * <p>Neither event is cancellable, so there is nothing to carry back: the surviving hook has already decided
 * and the MinecraftForge side only needs to be told. Same shape as the level lifecycle and the ticks.
 *
 * <p>The argument order is not the same on the two sides. NeoForge's event is {@code (Player, Entity)} and
 * reads back as {@code getEntity()} / {@code getTarget()}; MinecraftForge's hook takes
 * {@code (Entity target, Player player)}. Getting that backwards would compile and deliver every event with its
 * two halves swapped, which is the kind of thing that looks like the bridge working.
