/**
 * Re-points an {@code @At} whose call the surviving carrier gave extra parameters.
 *
 * <p>A carrier routinely extends a vanilla method rather than replacing it, and the merge keeps whichever half
 * won. {@code CustomPacketPayload.codec} is vanilla's {@code (FallbackProvider, List)}; NeoForge's takes
 * {@code (FallbackProvider, List, ConnectionProtocol, PacketFlow)}, and that is the one every call site in this
 * base uses — vanilla's is still DECLARED, so nothing looks wrong, and nothing calls it. A mixin compiled against
 * vanilla names the short descriptor, its injection point matches nothing, and Mixin reports only that an anchor
 * did not resolve.
 *
 * <p>What that costs is not a missing feature. Polymer patches the payload codec exactly there — it is how every
 * Polymer payload becomes encodable — and with the point unmatched its {@code polymer:hello} went out with
 * vanilla's unknown-id fallback codec. The client was disconnected at world join on
 * {@code HelloS2CPayload cannot be cast to DiscardedPayload}: a Netty stack naming the mod and the game, and
 * nothing about a method signature that grew two parameters.
 *
 * <h2>Which handler contracts survive appended arguments</h2>
 *
 * <p>Moving a point is only safe when the handler's signature does not describe the CALL. {@code @Inject} takes
 * the enclosing method's parameters and {@code @ModifyExpressionValue} takes the value the call returned, so
 * neither cares how many arguments the call has. {@code @WrapOperation}, {@code @Redirect} and the
 * {@code @ModifyArg} family mirror the call's own arguments, and pointing one of those at a longer call makes
 * Mixin reject the handler outright — which is exactly what happened to fabric-networking's own
 * {@code @WrapOperation} on this same method the first time this rule was written without the restriction.
 *
 * <p>A single-argument {@code @ModifyArg} is also safe when it declares an explicit original argument index
 * and both its parameter and return type equal that argument. Appending parameters cannot change that index.
 * A handler receiving the entire argument list or relying on an inferred index remains untouched.
 *
 * <p>The move itself is a prefix, and only a prefix: same owner, same name, same return type, and the parameters
 * the mixin named must be the FIRST ones of the call it lands on. It fires only when the named call is nowhere in
 * the bodies the injector selects and exactly ONE widened call is; two and it declines, because picking between
 * overloads is how an injection lands silently in the wrong place.
 *
 * <p>The same holds for a construction. NeoForge builds {@code BlockParticleOption} with the block position appended
 * in {@code Entity.spawnSprintParticle} and {@code LivingEntity.checkFallDamage}; fabric-particles'
 * {@code @ModifyExpressionValue} names vanilla's {@code NEW (ParticleType, BlockState)} there, so it attached nowhere
 * and a mob's landing dust and sprint dust never learned the ground block. An {@code @At(NEW)} whose target is a
 * constructor descriptor moves the same way — only for the argument-blind injectors, pairing each {@code NEW} with
 * its own {@code <init>} ({@code -Dforbric.mixinAtWidenNew=off} for this part alone).
 *
 * <h2>One decision, two readers</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link MixinFit} judges a mixin at config-read time, before this rewrite runs, and counted an {@code @At(INVOKE)}
 * as resolved whenever a widened call existed — for ANY injector. The rewrite moved only the argument-blind kinds and a
 * fixed-index {@code @ModifyArg}, never a handler in a {@code @Group}. So creativecore's {@code require=1}
 * {@code @Redirect} of {@code RegistryFriendlyByteBuf.decorator(RegistryAccess)}, which NeoForge's configuration
 * listener calls with a {@code ConnectionType} appended, read FIT: no "applies only partially" line, no preflight row,
 * and nothing warned before its miss took the class down. {@link #wouldMove} is the rewrite's own decision, and both
 * the rewrite and the verdict ask it — now including the static-call redirects the next section moves.
 *
 * <h2>A redirect of a widened static call</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@code @Redirect} mirrors the call and REPLACES it, which is why the rule above leaves it alone: on the merged
 * base the call it would replace is the carrier's extended one, and what the carrier does with its appended arguments
 * is then gone at that call. For an instance call that also skips every override of the carrier's method
 * (fabric-renderer-api's {@code hasMaterialFlag} redirects would have overridden every NeoForge model's context-aware
 * flag), so an instance call never moves. A static call has no override to skip, but its appended arguments can still be
 * the carrier's mechanism — NeoForge's four-argument {@code CustomPacketPayload.codec} is where its payload registry
 * joins the codec, and a Fabric redirect there would take NeoForge's payloads off the wire — so a static call moves only
 * along a reviewed row of {@link #REDIRECTABLE}, each with why replacing the carrier's call is the replacement vanilla's
 * was.
 *
 * <p>The handler is renamed aside and a method of its name and annotation takes the widened call's arguments and hands
 * the original the ones it was written for, in place, followed by whatever of the target's own arguments it captured.
 * creativecore's {@code ServerConfigurationPacketListenerImplMixin} and its client twin redirect
 * {@code RegistryFriendlyByteBuf.decorator(RegistryAccess)} to build their own {@code CreativeByteBuf} for the play
 * phase; NeoForge appends the {@code ConnectionType} it records on the buffer, and with the point unmatched the required
 * redirect stopped a strict launch that native Fabric runs. Only {@code @At(INVOKE)}, only when every widened call in
 * the selected bodies is an {@code invokestatic} of one widened descriptor, and only for a handler that takes the named
 * call's arguments first and returns its type. {@code -Dforbric.mixinAtWidenRedirect=off} leaves these where they are.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.mixinAtWiden=off} leaves every injection point as compiled.
