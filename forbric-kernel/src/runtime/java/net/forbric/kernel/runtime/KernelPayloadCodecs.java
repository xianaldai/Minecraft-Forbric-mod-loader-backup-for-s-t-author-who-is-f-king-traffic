/**
 * Builds every custom-payload codec through vanilla's {@code codec(fallback, types)} again, so a mod hooking that
 * method takes part, while the codec built is still NeoForge's protocol-aware one.
 *
 * <p>The merged packet classes call only NeoForge's {@code codec(fallback, types, protocol, flow)}; vanilla's
 * overload is still there, with its own body, and nothing calls it. Carpet adds its {@code carpet:hello} type at
 * the HEAD of vanilla's overload (and re-calls it with the longer list), so its type was in no codec: a dedicated
 * server running Carpet could not encode the hello and disconnected every player as they logged in.
 *
 * <p>{@code PayloadCodecFunnelInjector} makes NeoForge's overload call {@link #through}, which records the protocol
 * and flow for this thread and calls vanilla's; vanilla's, inside that call, hands back to NeoForge's with them.
