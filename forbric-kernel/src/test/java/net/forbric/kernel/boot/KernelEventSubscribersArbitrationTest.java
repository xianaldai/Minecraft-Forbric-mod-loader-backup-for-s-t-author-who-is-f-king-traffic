/**
 * A universal jar's event subscribers must be registered for ONE family, the one that owns the jar.
 *
 * <p>Such a jar ships one subscriber class per family and arbitration has already picked which family runs it.
 * Registering both means the same handler runs twice for every event both families post — double drops, double
 * damage, double packets — and the mod cannot notice, because each call looks like the only one.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a shape test</h2>
 *
 * <p>Honestly: no pack in any gate has a jar of that shape. The two universal jars in the gates ship their
 * subscriber classes for one family only, so the duplicate never occurs there and a live assertion would pass
 * whether or not the guard exists. Proving it live needs a purpose-built universal jar carrying a subscriber for
 * each Forge family, which does not exist yet. What IS assertable is that the registration pass asks arbitration
 * at all, and asks before it dispatches on family — which is exactly the line that was missing.
