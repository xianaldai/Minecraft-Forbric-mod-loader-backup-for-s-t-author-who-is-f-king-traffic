/**
 * Forbric's one version vocabulary: compare two versions, and evaluate a Fabric-style predicate against one.
 *
 * <p>The three ecosystems write version requirements in two dialects — Fabric's predicate strings
 * ({@code ">=0.15.0"}, {@code ">=47 <48"}, {@code "~1.2.3"}) and the Forge families' Maven ranges
 * ({@code "[47,48)"}). {@link UnifiedDependency} normalises to the Fabric dialect because that is the one that can
 * express everything the other can; this evaluates it. Maven ranges are parsed by
 * {@code ForgeVersionRangeTranslator} on the way in, so nothing downstream has to know which ecosystem a
 * requirement came from — which is the entire point of a unified dependency.
 *
 * <p><b>Comparison</b> splits on {@code .} and {@code -}, ignores {@code +} build metadata, and compares
 * segment by segment: numeric against numeric
 * numerically, anything else lexicographically, a number outranking a qualifier at the same position. Where one
 * version runs out of segments, what the OTHER has left decides: trailing zeros are padding, so {@code 1.0.0}
 * equals {@code 1.0}; a trailing non-zero number makes it larger, so {@code 26.2.0.7.1} follows {@code 26.2.0.7};
 * and a trailing qualifier makes it SMALLER — {@code 1.0-beta} precedes {@code 1.0}, the semver pre-release rule,
 * and the reason a {@code -beta} NeoForge compares sanely.
 *
 * <p><b>Two failure directions, one engine.</b> {@link #matches} treats an unreadable predicate as satisfied and
 * {@link #matchesStrictly} treats it as unsatisfied. Both are right for their callers — a diagnostic must not
 * accuse a mod over a predicate it could not read, and a resolver must not admit a dependency it could not check —
 * and the point of putting them here is that the difference is now a named argument instead of two separate
 * implementations that drifted apart. There were two: this class and {@code KernelMetadataSupport}, and they
 * disagreed about {@code ^}, which is the most common shape in the Fabric ecosystem.
 *
 * <h2>The shorthands are Fabric's, verified against Fabric Loader</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ~} and {@code ^} are read off {@code VersionComparisonOperator} in fabric-loader 0.19.5:
 * {@code ~} is {@code SAME_TO_NEXT_MINOR} (same major AND same minor, at or above the floor) and {@code ^} is
 * {@code SAME_TO_NEXT_MAJOR} (same major, at or above the floor). There is NO npm-style "leftmost non-zero"
 * rule — {@code ^0.15.0} admits {@code 0.16.0} here, as it does under Fabric. An earlier version of this class
 * implemented npm's rule on the reasoning that most Fabric mods are 0.x and a plain major bound lets every
 * breaking release through. That reasoning is sound and irrelevant: a mod that loads under Fabric has to load
 * under Forbric, so the dialect is not ours to improve.
