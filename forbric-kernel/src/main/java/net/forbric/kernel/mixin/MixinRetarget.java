/**
 * Rebinds a guest injector from a merge-added DELEGATING STUB to the method that carries the body it wants.
 *
 * <p>NeoForge's patch of {@code SimpleContainer.setItem(int, ItemStack)} moved the body — including the
 * {@code setChanged()} call — into a new {@code setItem(int, ItemStack, boolean)} and left the vanilla-shaped
 * method as {@code aload/iload/aload/iconst_0/invokevirtual setItem(…Z)V/return}. fabric-transfer-api-v1's
 * {@code SimpleContainerMixin} selects the vanilla shape by explicit descriptor and {@code @Redirect}s the
 * {@code setChanged()} inside it; on the merged base the call is not there, the mixin reads PARTIAL, and every
 * hopper or pipe transfer through a Fabric mod spams {@code setChanged} for each intermediate step. The same
 * shape hits {@code BaseContainerBlockEntity.setItem}.
 *
 * <p>Rule R1: an injector whose selector carries an explicit descriptor and resolves to a method that is a pure
 * delegating stub — loads, constants, argument construction ({@code NEW/DUP/INVOKESPECIAL <init>/CHECKCAST}),
 * exactly one call to a same-owner same-name method with a different descriptor, and a return; no branch —
 * whose {@code @At} member is absent from the stub but present in that delegate, has its selector rewritten to
 * the delegate, provided the handler does not depend on the stub's parameter list: {@code @At}-driven kinds
 * ({@code @Redirect}, {@code @WrapOperation}, {@code @ModifyArg(s)}, {@code @ModifyExpressionValue},
 * {@code @ModifyReturnValue}, {@code @ModifyConstant}, {@code @WrapWithCondition}) whose captures of the target's
 * arguments, if any, the stub passes to the delegate in place (MixinStubRebind's rule, shared), or an {@code @Inject}
 * that captures nothing or exactly the delegate's parameters; and every {@code @Local} sugar parameter must name a
 * type the delegate's own parameters carry (fabric-content-registries' {@code FuelValuesMixin} captures the
 * {@code HolderLookup.Provider} and {@code FeatureFlagSet} that only the stub has, so it is left alone).
 *
 * <p>The rewrite is applied to the {@link ClassNode} Mixin receives from the bytecode provider
 * ({@code ForbricMixinService.getClassNode}), never to jar bytes: the plan is computed once by
 * {@link KernelGuestMixinAdapter} when it sees the PARTIAL verdict, kept only if the rewritten mixin re-evaluates
 * better, and remembered by the mixin's internal name. {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget=off} computes no plan and
 * edits nothing — the PARTIAL lines return exactly as before.

	/**
	 * Rule R3: a selector whose method has lost its body to a carrier's RENAME, where the class still declares the
	 * renamed body under the SAME descriptor and still calls it.
	 *
	 * <p>NeoForge's patch of {@code PersistentEntitySectionManager.addEntity} posts its entity-join event and hands the
	 * rest to a new {@code addEntityWithoutEvent} with the identical descriptor: vanilla's body, renamed. Carpet's scarpet
	 * events and architectury's entity-add event anchor inside that body; on the merged base every one of their anchors
	 * is in the renamed method, and the mixin reads PARTIAL.
	 *
	 * <p>R1 cannot take this: it needs an explicit descriptor in the selector and a body that is nothing but a
	 * delegation, and this dispatcher is neither. What makes the rewrite safe instead is the IDENTICAL descriptor
	 * together with a WHOLE body: the handler's parameters and its {@code CallbackInfo} bind as they did, and the
	 * body it was written against — its locals, the points a slice or a {@code @Share} spans — is all in the renamed
	 * method.
	 *
	 * <p>Demanded, all of it: every resolvable {@code @At} member of the injector absent from the method the selector
	 * names, present in the renamed one, exactly ONE method in the class fitting that description, and that one proven
	 * the carrier's rename of this body: {@link CarrierRenames} rows for the mod's ecosystem, every anchor one of the
	 * calls or field accesses they say moved there (an anchor the reference's method never made misses on the mod's own
	 * game too) and bound no more often than the reference's method made it (an ordinal only where the count is the
	 * same), and the live class still calling it. The bytes alone are not proof. An audit of the moves they made over 655 mod jars
	 * found seven of 15 wrong: a vanilla method of the same shape that happened to carry the anchor (text_styles'
	 * {@code Style.withColor(I)} into {@code withShadowColor(I)}, which {@code withColor} never calls), and a renamed
	 * body nothing calls (malilib's tooltip hook into NeoForge's {@code addDetailsToTooltipComponents}, where it bound,
	 * never ran, and read as fitting). The rows' ecosystems also keep a NeoForge mod where it is: it was compiled against
	 * the rename, and misses natively the same way.
	 *
	 * <p>A renamed body nothing calls is still where the mod's body is, and a required injector that binds nowhere stops
	 * a strict launch: kept out of it, malilib's last tooltip hook stopped every strict client with malilib (Litematica,
	 * MiniHUD, Tweakeroo) and made the default policy ask. So a pair the census marks {@link CarrierRenames#UNCALLED}
	 * moves too, when the method is private and the live class does not call it, and the move says the injector never
	 * runs there, as MixinFit and the final-class check then report it (a never-running injector marks its mod's row and
	 * stops nothing). {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget.renameCensus.uncalled=off} leaves it unbound.
	 *
	 * <p>A {@link CarrierRenames.Kind#PIECE PIECE} pair carries only part of the body — NeoForge's
	 * {@code addDetailsToTooltipTail} is the advanced tail of vanilla's tooltip, {@code lambda$startSleepInBed$0} the
	 * checks before the sleep — and there the descriptor is not enough: cancelling returns from the piece where vanilla
	 * returned from the method, a captured local or a slice may lie in another piece, and a {@code @Share} no longer
	 * reaches the injectors that stayed. Its handler must depend on nothing but the call and the target's arguments, as
	 * R4's must ({@link #movableWhole}), and the arguments must be the method's: a handler that takes any, plainly or
	 * as an {@code @Local(argsOnly = true)}, moves only when the method hands the piece its own
	 * ({@link CarrierRenames#handsOwnArguments}) — NeoForge's {@code extractEntityInInventoryFollowsMouse} hands its
	 * piece angles where it was given the mouse position; a method that stores into a parameter before handing it on
	 * does not hand on its own. fabric-item-api's {@code postTooltipsAdvanced} shares an index with the injectors left in
	 * {@code addDetailsToTooltip}, and stays.
	 *
	 * <p>A handler that can cancel moves into a piece only where the cancel still leaves the method with the value the
	 * handler gave: a {@link CarrierRenames.Exit#LEFT LEFT} pair, whose method returns the piece's result whenever it is
	 * an {@code Either} left (re-checked on the live bytes, {@link CarrierRenames#returnsLefts}), and a handler whose
	 * every cancel is {@code setReturnValue(Either.left(..))} ({@link #cancelsOnlyWithLefts}). NeoForge's
	 * {@code startSleepInBed} hands its lambda's answer to {@code EventHooks.canPlayerStartSleeping} and returns it when it
	 * names a problem, so apoli's {@code preventAvianSleep} and fabric-entity-events' {@code @Cancellable}
	 * {@code redirectSleepDirection} cancel the lambda the way vanilla's own checks in it say no: NeoForge's
	 * {@code CanPlayerSleepEvent} sees the problem, as it sees vanilla's, and the method returns it. apoli cancels with
	 * {@code Either.left(null)}, which DFU's {@code left()} cannot read ({@code Optional.of}): NeoForge's hook throws on it
	 * inside {@code startSleepInBed}. On vanilla's {@code BedBlock} path that is no change — on apoli's own game
	 * {@code BedBlock} throws on {@code problem.message()} — but a caller that checks for a null problem (another mod's
	 * sleeping bag or bed) fails here too, where on apoli's own game it would not. That is no regression: before the
	 * census R3 moved the handler there on the bytes alone. {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget.renameCensus.leftExit=off}
	 * keeps every handler that can cancel out of a piece.
	 *
	 * <p>On a whole {@link CarrierRenames.Kind#RENAME RENAME} a handler that shares a value moves only with every handler
	 * of its mixin that shares it in the same method ({@link #shareGroupMoves}).
	 *
	 * <p>A second candidate and the rule declines — a rewrite to the wrong body is an injection running somewhere the
	 * mod did not ask for, silently, which is worse than the anchors simply missing — unless R4 can tell which of them
	 * is a piece of the method the mod named. {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget.renameCensus=off} moves on the bytes alone
	 * again, as before the census.

	 * its result, only the point. And only with no slice, {@code @Group}, sugar, parameter annotation or {@code @At}
	 * args; a shift of BEFORE or AFTER and no ordinal past the first (the row's call is made once); for a mod of an
	 * ecosystem the row lists (the others were compiled against the replacement, or against neither, and miss natively
	 * too); in a mixin with one target. A handler that captures locals moves only when the live method's local variable
	 * table holds exactly those at the new call ({@link InsertedLambdaArgumentShim#localsAtCall}) — Mixin reads the same
	 * table to decide what it captures; with no table there is no proof and the point stays.
	 *
	 * <p>The handler then runs where it never ran on this base, and a {@code LinkageError} from it — code compiled
	 * against another base — is not an {@code Exception}: in the one row's method it would escape the per-file catch,
	 * fail the whole resource reload, and a failed reload drops every resource pack. So the move also puts the handler
	 * behind a guard ({@link Element#GUARD}) that says so once and skips it, which is where things stood before the
	 * move. {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget.substitutedCall=off} leaves every such point as compiled, and
	 * {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget.substitutedCall.guard=off} moves it without the guard.

	 *   <li>a selector naming the vanilla method — by name, or by vanilla's descriptor — whose every point is
	 *       {@code HEAD}, {@code RETURN} or {@code TAIL}, and whose handler takes vanilla's arguments and its callback
	 *       (or the callback alone), moves to the replacement: the handler is renamed aside and a method of its name and
