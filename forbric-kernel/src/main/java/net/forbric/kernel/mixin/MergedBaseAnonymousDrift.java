/**
 * Vanilla anonymous classes ({@code Outer$N}) whose NAME the merge kept but whose CLASS it did not.
 *
 * <p>javac numbers anonymous classes per outer class in source order. A NeoForge patch that adds an anonymous
 * class before vanilla's renumbers every later one, and the merge keeps one class per name — so
 * {@code ByteBufCodecs$13} on this base is a different codec from vanilla's, whose body now lives at
 * {@code $12}. A mixin targeting {@code ByteBufCodecs$13} applies cleanly, every anchor resolves, and its
 * injections bind to unrelated code. Nothing else can see that.
 *
 * <p>Three buckets, derived from vanilla and the merged base by {@code MergedBaseAnonymousDriftTest}. The
 * identity of an anonymous class is its superclass plus its non-{@code <init>} method set, and a patch may ADD
 * methods to it (NeoForge gives {@code MappedRegistry$2} data-map accessors): {@code $N} still holds vanilla's
 * class while every vanilla method is there. Only a vanilla method that is GONE from {@code $N} says otherwise:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #RELOCATED}: vanilla's method set exists at another {@code $M} of the same outer class — the
 *       candidates are listed, several when the body is duplicated.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #RESHAPED}: vanilla's method set exists nowhere in the outer class any more (a real method lost,
 *       or the superclass changed).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #CAPTURE_ONLY}: same methods, only the constructor descriptor or the captured {@code val$}
 *       fields differ. Pinned for the record, never flagged — chat_heads targets {@code ChatComponent$1} this way
 *       and its anchors are exactly where vanilla put them.</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@link MixinFit} adds a SOFT unresolved anchor for a {@code @Mixin} target in the first two sets: listed in
 * the reason, PARTIAL at most, never UNFIT — so nothing that works today is dropped, and the adapter names the
 * mod and where vanilla's body went.
