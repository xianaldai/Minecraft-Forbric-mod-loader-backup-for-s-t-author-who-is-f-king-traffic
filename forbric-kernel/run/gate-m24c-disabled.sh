# M24c switched-off gate — a jar listed in forbric-disabled.txt stays in mods/ and is loaded by nobody.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The fix every crash analysis and load report ends in is "take it out of your mods folder", and
# forbric-disabled.txt is the version of that a player can undo by deleting a line (the crash-suspects offer writes
# it for them). DisabledModsTest proves the decision and every reader of it with synthetic jars; nothing proved a
# real boot. A suppressed jar that some walk of mods/ still reads would construct its mod anyway, and this is the
# only place that would show it.
#
# Staged: the Fabric canary (with its nested library) and the NeoForge canary. The file switches the Fabric one off:
# its entrypoint must not run, the server must still reach Done under strict policy (switching a mod off is not a
# failure), and the load report must name the jar. A pending crash-suspects.json naming the NeoForge canary proves
# the offer is read before arbitration and that a server only logs it. The control has neither file and must load
# the Fabric canary.
