/**
 * The three NeoForge worldgen mechanisms the byte merge left with no driver, and their guards.
 *
 * <h2>Data maps</h2>
 *
 * <p>NeoForge loads its data maps from a {@code DataMapLoader} that genuine NeoForge attaches to the server's
 * resource reload, in the patched {@code ReloadableServerResources}. The merge kept MinecraftForge's version of
 * that class, and a constant-pool scan of the whole merged base finds {@code DataMapLoader} named by NOTHING —
 * so no data map has ever been loaded in a Forbric instance. That is ten built-ins (compostables, furnace fuels,
 * oxidizables, waxables, strippables, parrot imitations, vibration frequencies, villager gifts, villager
 * distances, monster-room mobs) plus every data map any NeoForge mod declares, all silently empty.
 *
 * <h2>Monster rooms</h2>
 *
 * <p>The visible half of that. The merged {@code MonsterRoomFeature.randomEntityId} is two instructions —
 * {@code invokestatic MonsterRoomHooks.getRandomMonsterRoomMob} — reading a static {@code WeightedList} that only
 * a {@code DataMapsUpdatedEvent} listener fills, so it was null and threw. The kernel had answered that by
 * neutering {@code MonsterRoomFeature.place} outright, which means NO dungeon, therefore no spawner and no
 * dungeon chest, in EVERY world every player generated, mods or no mods.
 *
 * <p>So the call goes through {@link #randomMonsterRoomMob} instead, which falls back to vanilla's own set when
 * the data map is not there. The fallback is not a guess: vanilla's {@code MonsterRoomFeature.MOBS} is
 * {@code {SKELETON, ZOMBIE, ZOMBIE, SPIDER}} and NeoForge's shipped
 * {@code data/neoforge/data_maps/entity_type/monster_room_mobs.json} is skeleton 100 / spider 100 / zombie 200 —
 * the same distribution, which is what makes a fallback honest rather than a different game.
 *
 * <h2>Biome and structure modifiers</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ServerLifecycleHooks.runModifiers} was neutered too, because {@code neoforge:biome_modifier} was not
 * declared. It is now — {@code KernelLifecycle.registerDataPackRegistries} posts NeoForge's
 * {@code DataPackRegistryEvent.NewRegistry} and both modifier registries come back among the declared ones. But
 * un-neutering it alone would put an unguarded {@code lookupOrThrow} on the path of every server start, so the
 * CALL SITE inside {@code handleServerAboutToStart} is redirected here instead, where a failure costs the
 * modifiers and not the boot.

	/**
	 * Is the live monster-room data map still exactly what NeoForge ships, with nothing added or changed?

	 * <p>Why this decides which draw to make. Both sides agree on the distribution — vanilla's
	 * {@code {SKELETON, ZOMBIE, ZOMBIE, SPIDER}} is 25/50/25, and NeoForge's shipped weights are 100/200/100 —
	 * but they do not agree on WHICH mob a given seed produces: vanilla draws {@code nextInt(4)}, which
	 * {@code BitRandomSource} answers from the high bits of a power-of-two bound, and the weighted list draws
	 * {@code nextInt(400)}, which goes through {@code next(31) % 400} and reads the low ones. The two are near
	 * enough to independent that the same dungeon in the same seed comes out a different mob about five times in
	 * eight. Measured, zero mods, one seed: all six dungeons in the compared area disagreed with vanilla.
	 *
	 * <p>So while nothing has changed the map, the vanilla draw is the one that reproduces vanilla's world, and
	 * it costs nothing — the distribution is identical. The moment a mod adds an entry or reweights one, the map
	 * is what the player asked for and it wins. Either path spends exactly one {@code nextInt}, so the feature's
	 * random stream carries on identically whichever is taken.
	 *
	 * <p>Reflective because the list is {@code MonsterRoomHooks}' own private static, filled from its
	 * {@code DataMapsUpdatedEvent} listener; there is no accessor that returns it. Any failure answers "not the
	 * default", which keeps the data map in charge — the conservative direction, since that is what this method
	 * would have done unconditionally before.
