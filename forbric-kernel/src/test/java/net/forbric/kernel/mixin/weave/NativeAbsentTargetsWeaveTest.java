/**
 * An injector whose target a Fabric mod's own platform — vanilla — lacks too, through the real weave: dropped the way
 * native Mixin drops it — the injector only — while the rest of its mixin applies.
 *
 * <p>The fixture is Not Enough Crashes' {@code MixinTileEntity} in shape ({@code GadgetMixin}): a field of its own with
 * an initializer, an interface so the probe can see the rest arrive, and one {@code @Inject} into
 * {@code populateReport}, which the game's {@code Gadget} does not have and nothing in the shipped difference table
 * says it ever had — in a Fabric mod's {@code required: true} config with no {@code defaultRequire}. The fixture jar is
 * not the merged base the table was derived from, so every run but {@code unmatched} names the fixture's members digest
 * as the base to trust ({@code -Dforbric.mixinFit.nativeAbsent.base}). Five runs of one child JVM each:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code kept}: the default. The adapter names the target as absent from vanilla and hands Mixin the whole mixin;
 *       Gadget comes out tagged, carrying the field and the merged handler with no call to it, and the mod has no
 *       finding.</li>
 *   <li>{@code off}: {@code -Dforbric.mixinFit.nativeAbsent=off}, the RED control. The old verdict: UNFIT, the mixin
 *       left out of its config, Gadget untagged, and a CONFIRMED required finding — what stopped Not Enough Crashes'
 *       server under the STRICT policy.</li>
 *   <li>{@code unmatched}: no base named, so the kernel reads the fixture jar's members digest itself, finds it is not
 *       the table's, says so once and answers nothing: the old verdict again. This is the check that keeps a table
 *       from speaking for a base it was not derived from, run end to end.</li>
 *   <li>{@code newer}: the mod's manifest requires {@code minecraft >=26.3}, so vanilla 26.2 is not the game it was
 *       built for, and nothing is answered: the old verdict, and one line naming the requirement.</li>
 *   <li>{@code mixin-alone}: {@code -Dforbric.guestMixinAdapter=off}, so Mixin decides by itself, as it does on native
 *       Fabric. {@code kept} must define exactly the Gadget this run defines: that is "dropped like native".</li>
 * </ul>
