/**
 * The creative search trees, filed where the merged creative screen reads them.
 *
 * <p>Called from the three {@code SessionSearchTrees} methods whose merged bodies are MinecraftForge's
 * ({@code CreativeSearchTreesInjector}): vanilla's two producers {@code updateCreativeTooltips(Provider, List)} and
 * {@code updateCreativeTags(List)}, and MinecraftForge's reader {@code getSearchTree(Key)}. As merged, those three
 * kept their trees in the class's private MinecraftForge map, while the creative screen — NeoForge's — reads
 * NeoForge's {@link CreativeModeTabSearchRegistry}. A mod that rebuilt the creative tabs itself and then refreshed the
 * search through vanilla's methods (TCDCommons does it on every join) filled a map nothing reads, and took the
 * screen's own rebuild with it: the tabs had not changed since, so the screen skipped its rebuild and searched an
 * empty tree.
 *
 * <p>Each producer refreshes every tab that has a search bar, the search tab from the list it was given and every
 * other from its own contents. That is what MinecraftForge's body did and what the screen's own rebuild does — a
 * superset of NeoForge's, which refreshes only the search tab and leaves a mod's searchable tab empty after such a
 * caller.
