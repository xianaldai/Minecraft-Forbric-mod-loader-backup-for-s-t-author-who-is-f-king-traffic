/**
 * The MinecraftForge half of the same wall {@link KernelNeoConditions} holds up on the NeoForge side.
 *
 * <h2>Why there are three evaluators and this is the third</h2>
 *
 * <p>The merged {@code ResourceManagerRegistryLoadTask} carries BOTH ecosystems' patches at once, which javap on
 * the staged base shows plainly: {@code load} calls
 * {@code net/minecraftforge/common/crafting/conditions/ConditionCodec.wrap} at offset 15, while its own
 * {@code lambda$load$1} builds NeoForge's {@code ConditionalOps}. {@code LootPool} names the same MinecraftForge
 * class. So MinecraftForge's condition evaluator is live, global, and strict — over every datapack-registry
 * element, whichever ecosystem shipped the file, and (since ForgeLootPoolConditionsInjector, see
 * {@link #poolElementCodec}) over every loot pool.
 *
 * <p>Its failure path is the one already paid for once on the NeoForge side. {@code OptionalConditionalDecoder}
 * parses the {@code forge:condition} value through {@code ICondition.CODEC}; a registry dispatch that cannot
 * resolve the type returns {@code DataResult.error}, which becomes "Failed to load registries due to errors",
 * which is a world that does not open. The NeoForge half of this was fixed when waystones demonstrated it; this
 * is the mirror that had not been hit yet by the mods tested so far.
 *
 * <h2>Not SAFE_CODEC</h2>
 *
 * <p>MinecraftForge already ships something that looks like the answer and is not.
 * {@code ICondition.SAFE_CODEC} is {@code CODEC.orElse(FalseCondition.INSTANCE)} — verified in {@code <clinit>}
 * at offsets 24-35 — so a condition it cannot parse evaluates to FALSE and the element is DROPPED. That turns a
 * loud failure into content silently missing, which is worse than the crash it replaces and is the exact shape
 * this project keeps paying for.
 *
 * <p>A condition type MinecraftForge does not own is not MinecraftForge's to judge. It decodes to a condition
 * that does not veto, the element loads, and the ecosystem that owns the id decides. Failing the parse loses the
 * element, the registry and the world; ignoring one condition's opinion loses one condition's opinion.
