/**
 * Pins a name-only {@code @Inject} selector to the overload the handler was actually written for, and says why a
 * selector cannot bind when that is two files away.
 *
 * <p>A mixin usually names its target by NAME alone — {@code @Inject(method = "handleCustomClickAction")} — because
 * on the loader it was built for there is only one method with that name. The byte merge sometimes produces two:
 * NeoForge's patch put {@code MinecraftServer.handleCustomClickAction(Identifier, Optional, ServerPlayer, GameProfile)}
 * — fire NeoForge's event, then call vanilla's — in front of vanilla's {@code (Identifier, Optional)}, and the merge
 * kept both, NeoForge's first.
 *
 * <p>Mixin binds a bare name to the FIRST declared method of that name (the selector's default quantifier is one
 * match) and only then checks the handler against it. When that is the other ecosystem's overload the descriptors do
 * not agree, and the result is not "try the sibling" — it is {@code InvalidInjectionException}, which fails the whole
 * mixin class and takes every other injection in it along. carpet-org-addition's dialog hook did exactly that: its
 * handler takes vanilla's two arguments, and vanilla's method is one entry further down the list.
 *
 * <p>So such a selector is made explicit, {@code name(descriptor)returnType}, and only where Mixin's own binding
 * fails: the injector names that one bare selector and nothing else (with several, Mixin skips a target that does
 * not fit instead of failing, so the injection works and a pin would only add one), and the first overload does not
 * take the handler's arguments by Mixin's rule (all of the target's parameters, or none). A handler that loosens
 * that rule with {@code @Coerce} is left alone. A selector whose first overload binds is never touched, even when
 * another overload would fit better — that is Mixin's choice, the mod may rely on it, and an earlier version that
 * pinned by fit alone would have moved 26 working selectors on the popular set. The replacement must then be the ONE other overload the handler
 * fits exactly: the same parameters, the callback its return type takes, the same static-ness. Zero fits or two and
 * the selector stays as the mod wrote it, because a guess would put the injection, silently, on a method the mod did
 * not ask for. Nothing is invented: the descriptor written in is one the target class declares. A mixin with several
 * targets is pinned only when every target that declares the name lands on the same descriptor.
 *
 * <p>Lambdas are left to the pruner and the shims ({@link MixinHandlerShim}, {@link InsertedLambdaArgumentShim}): a
 * lambda's name is a counter, so two bodies sharing {@code lambda$foo$0} are not two overloads of one method. When a
 * lambda selector cannot bind because the shape it was written for was a body the merge dropped, the kernel says so
 * instead, in the log and on the mod's row of the load report.
 *
 * <p>Only {@code @Inject}. Its handler-compatibility rule is the one that can be checked here — the target's
 * parameters, then a {@code CallbackInfo}, then whatever locals the handler captures. The other injectors
 * ({@code @Redirect}, {@code @ModifyArg}, the MixinExtras ones) each have a different and less mechanical rule,
 * and guessing at one of those is exactly the wrong pin this declines to make.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.mixinOverloadPin=off} leaves every selector alone and explains nothing.
