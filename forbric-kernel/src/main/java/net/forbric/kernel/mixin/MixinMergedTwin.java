/**
 * Gives a guest mixin the merge's RENAMED twin of its target as a second target.
 *
 * <p>Two anonymous classes could not keep one name through the byte merge, so NeoForge's copy was renamed with a
 * {@code $forbricneo} suffix: {@code CustomPacketPayload$1} and {@code CustomPacketPayload$1$forbricneo} both
 * exist in the merged base. A guest mixin names the vanilla one, because that is the only name its own platform
 * has — and the merged code that actually runs instantiates the twin. The mixin applies cleanly, to the half
 * nothing calls.
 *
 * <p>Bad Packets is the case that paid for it. Its {@code MixinCustomPacketPayload_1} makes that stream codec
 * implement {@code ChannelCodecFinder$Holder}, and its {@code ClientboundCustomPayloadPacket} mixin then casts
 * the live codec to that interface. The live codec is the twin, so joining a world died with
 * {@code ClassCastException: CustomPacketPayload$1$forbricneo cannot be cast to ChannelCodecFinder$Holder}, which
 * the client reports as "Failed to connect to the server — Internal Exception: ExceptionInInitializerError".
 * Nothing in that names the merge, the twin, or Bad Packets' mixin.
 *
 * <p>The twin is added, never substituted: the vanilla-named class is still real and other code still reaches it,
 * so a mixin that meant it keeps it. Targets are appended to {@code @Mixin}'s {@code targets} (the String form),
 * because a renamed anonymous class cannot be spelled as a class literal.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.mixinMergedTwins=off} leaves every target list as compiled.
