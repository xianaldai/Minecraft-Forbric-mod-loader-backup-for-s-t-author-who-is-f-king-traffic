# M20 gate — an unmet hard dependency reaches the PLAYER, not just the log.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The kernel has always detected this and always written one WARN about it. On a real pack that
# WARN said "biomesoplenty requires terrablender >=26.2.0.0.1 — not installed", and forty seconds later the game
# died on "Failed to load registries due to errors" with 455 unknown block ids — an error naming neither mod. One
# line in ten thousand is not a report; the player never saw it and could not have connected the two.
#
# So the same finding is now put in front of them before the window opens. This gate asserts BOTH halves of that,
# because each is a different way to get it wrong:
#   * on a CLIENT it must reach them
#   * on a dedicated SERVER it must NOT — a server blocked on a dialog nobody can see is strictly worse than the
#     log line it replaces, and every gate in this repo runs unattended
#
# The canary is a jar with nothing in it but a manifest declaring a dependency on a mod that does not exist. No
# code, nothing to compile: the thing under test is the audit and the dialog, and a canary with classes in it
# would only add ways for the gate to fail for an unrelated reason.
#
# THE SECOND CANARY covers the opposite mistake: a requirement the dialog must NOT report. The same library is
# spelled differently by each ecosystem -- Fabric "cloth-config", NeoForge "cloth_config" -- so under Forbric a
# NeoForge mod's requirement reads as NOT INSTALLED with the Fabric build sitting in the same mods folder. That is
# the one thing a dialog whose job is to be believed must never do. RED control:
#   M20_EXTRA_JVM='-Dforbric.crossEcosystemIds=off' -> "forbriccrosseco ... requires forbric_dep_canary >=1.0.0 —
#   not installed" is back and the cross-spelling INFO line is gone. Checks that name "1 finding(s)" in the
#   continue step go red with them, and say so: the false accusation is a second notice row. That IS the switch
#   working -- it puts back a finding that is not real. (Re-count the red checks when this gate is next run; the
#   steps changed when the notice and the confirmation became one window.)
#
# HOW A DIALOG IS TESTED WITH NOBODY TO CLICK IT: -Dforbric.dependencyDialog=dryRun runs the real path — writes
# the real report, forks the real child JVM, reads the real exit code — with AWT disabled inside the child, so it
# finds it cannot draw. Everything but the pixels.
#
# ONE WINDOW, AND THE ANSWER IS WHAT HAPPENS. When the candidate arbitration records an unmet hard dependency as a
# confirmed required loss, that loss needs an explicit continue, and the question is asked IN this window,
# fail-closed, not in a second one: the notice is folded into it. So what the unanswerable dry run must mean
# depends on the policy, and every step below sets its policy explicitly and reads the machine report instead of
# assuming:
#   * ask   — required losses present: ONE fork, which cannot draw, so nobody answered it: not consent, and not the
#             player's refusal either. The question moves into the game's own window, which asks on the title screen
#             before the player can open a world; a launch told to open one at once (--quickPlay…) is refused
#             instead (issue #57: on FCL the window's process cannot start at all, and reading that as
#             "no" stopped every launch while showing the player nothing). The old gate stayed green here on
#             "launching anyway" while the kernel stopped the launch nine lines later.
#   * continue — nothing needs an answer: the fail-open notice is forked once and says "launching anyway", and the
#             boot must really get past BOTH decisions — "Sound engine started" comes after the client-setup
#             decision inside Minecraft.<init>.
# With no required loss in the report, ask degrades to the continue case, and the gate asserts that instead -- which
# is what the dependency canary alone produces, so the last two steps add a mod that fails on purpose
# (build-broken-canary.sh) to put a real required loss in front of ask and of the off switch.
