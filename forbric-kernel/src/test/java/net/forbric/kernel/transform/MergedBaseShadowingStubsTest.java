/**
 * Methods the merge injected that hand off to an interface default while the superclass has a real one.
 *
 * <p>Measured across the whole merged base against both unmerged bases: 256 such methods, 253 of which exist in
 * neither unmerged base. {@code VehicleEntity.getDisplayName()} is one, and the method it bypasses,
 * {@code Entity.getDisplayName()}, is the one that applies team colours and prefixes — so a boat or minecart
 * loses its team formatting wherever its name is shown.
 *
 * <p>Why this rule is safe where a wider one once crashed every GUI screen at the title: a concrete superclass
 * method always beats an interface default, so when the chain has one there is nothing for competing defaults to
 * fight over. That crash happened in classes whose chain had none.
