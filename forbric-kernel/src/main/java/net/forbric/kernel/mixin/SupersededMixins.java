/**
 * Guest mixins whose job the kernel has taken over, so their failure is not the mod's failure.
 *
 * <p>A mixin that cannot apply normally means a mod lost something, and the Mods screen says so. Sometimes it
 * means the opposite: the kernel could not make the mixin fit, looked at what it was for, and did that job
 * itself somewhere else. Marking the mod then reports a loss that did not happen — and a report that cries wolf
 * is worse than no report, because the next real one is read the same way.
 *
 * <p>The bar for an entry here is deliberately high. It is not "the kernel has something similar"; it is that a
 * named kernel repair does <b>everything this mixin class does</b>, and was written for exactly this failure. A
 * mixin class with a second injection the kernel does not replace does not belong here, because suppressing the
 * mark would hide that half.
 *
 * <p>A name in this table is a CLAIM, and a claim resolves nothing on its own. The failure is recorded like any
 * other; it is resolved only when the class that carries the replacement is defined with the replacement actually
 * in its bytes, and only while the replacement's own switch is on. Resolving on the table entry alone let a
 * switched-off or never-installed repair report the loss as handled.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.supersededMixins=off} marks them like any other failure, which is how the claim in each
 * entry can be checked against what the game actually does.
