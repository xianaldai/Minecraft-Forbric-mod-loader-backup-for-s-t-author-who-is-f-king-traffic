# Run every checked-in gate. Overlaps the ones that can safely overlap; the scheduling lives in
# gates-parallel.py next door, which explains why a naive fan-out produces verdicts that prove nothing.
#
# The glob is still authoritative: gates-parallel.py discovers gate-m*.sh the same way this script used to, so
# there is no parallel gate list to forget to update. What a gate DOES have to say for itself is one line:
#
#     # GATE-PARALLEL: rundirs=server-kernel mem=1500
#
# rundirs names the run/ directories it owns while it runs (two gates naming the same one never run together),
# and mem is what it costs in MB. A gate without that line runs ALONE, and the run says so on stderr — a new
# gate written by someone who never read this is slow, not silently broken.
#
# `-j 1` is the old behaviour exactly: same order, same summary.txt, same exit code.

gates-all.sh [-j N|auto] [--mem-budget MB] [--skip gate-m12-multiplayer.sh] ... [--release] [--list]

  -j N           run up to N gates at once (default: auto — one slot per ~2 GB of budget, capped by cores).
                 -j 1 reproduces the old strictly-sequential run.
  --mem-budget   MB the running gates may claim between them (default: ~55% of physical RAM).
  --skip         do not run this gate; it is reported SKIP.
  --list         print the gate order and exit.
  --progress     also stream the running commentary to stderr.
  --release      an acceptance run: a --skip'd or EXPECTED_RED gate fails it (exit 1). A gate that did not run,
                 or did not pass, is not a passing gate, however it was declared.

This script's OUTPUT is exactly the RESULT lines, the same bytes as build/gates/summary.txt — a contract
gate-m0 asserts on, so nothing else may be printed to either stream. The running commentary (what started
when, on which slot and port, what each gate cost) goes to build/gates/progress.log instead; `tail -f` it.

The scheduler owns the ports: each concurrent slot gets its own block from 25700 up, and GATE_PORT / M1x_PORT /
M28_PORT / M32_PORT are exported per gate from it. A GATE_PORT set in the environment moves where the blocks start
instead, so two sweeps at once (two working trees) need two different GATE_PORTs.
