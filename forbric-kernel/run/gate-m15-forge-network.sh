# M15 gate — a traditional-Forge (MinecraftForge) mod's own network channel, both directions, over a socket.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. gate-m12 proved the configuration handshake and the Fabric/NeoForge registry syncs over a real
# socket, with a Forge mod on board that happens not to send packets. Forge mods that DO send packets — GUI sync,
# config sync on join, entity data — go through SimpleChannel → ForgePayload → the vanilla custom-payload packet,
# and every piece of Forge's plumbing under that lost the byte-merge to NeoForge's: its payload codec
# (ForgeHooks.getCustomPayloadCodec was the fallback in Forge's patched packets), its dispatch
# (ForgeHooks.onCustomPayload survived only in the play-phase server listener), and the per-connection channel
# bookkeeping its channels consult. Until this gate nothing ever sent a Forge packet on Forbric.
#
# The kernel's Forge canary (forbric-loader/run/livemod-src, built into forge-runtime/forbriclive.jar) builds a
# SimpleChannel "forbriclive:net": the server pings the first player it sees on the tick event, the client logs
# the ping and pongs back, the server logs the pong. Both ends run the canary and FallingTree — a real Forge mod
# that syncs its config to the client on join over its own channel — so the gate also asserts that nothing in
# that traffic failed to encode or decode.
#
# Port 25603, not the default — a developer or another agent session may have a server on 25565.
# GATE-PARALLEL: rundirs=fnet-server,fnet-client mem=3500
