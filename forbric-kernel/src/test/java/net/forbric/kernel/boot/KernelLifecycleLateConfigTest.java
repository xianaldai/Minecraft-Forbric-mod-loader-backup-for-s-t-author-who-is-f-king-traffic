/**
 * Pins which config types the late-open pass may touch.
 *
 * <p>The pass exists because a Fabric mod registering a config from a client entrypoint is too late for the early
 * pass, and nothing else opens a non-STARTUP config — so the mod reads a config that was registered and never
 * loaded, and gets an exception rather than a default.
 *
 * <p>SERVER's absence is the part worth a test. A SERVER config is per-world and the server-about-to-start hook
 * loads it from the world directory; opening one here would load it from the global config directory first, and
 * the carrier's warning for the collision is asserted ABSENT by gate-m13 and gate-m14. Nothing else states that
 * constraint where someone adding a type would see it.
