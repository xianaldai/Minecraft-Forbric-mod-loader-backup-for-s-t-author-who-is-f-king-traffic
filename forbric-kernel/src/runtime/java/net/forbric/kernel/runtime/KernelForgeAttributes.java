/**
 * The producer and the consumer of mod entity attributes, which the byte merge put on opposite sides.
 *
 * <p>Both ecosystems collect a mod's entity attributes the same way and into their own map:
 * {@code ForgeHooks.modifyAttributes()} posts {@code EntityAttributeCreationEvent} and fills
 * {@code ForgeHooks.FORGE_ATTRIBUTES}; {@code CommonHooks.modifyAttributes()} does the same for NeoForge. The
 * CONSUMER is vanilla's {@code DefaultAttributes}, and the merge kept exactly one of the two patches:
 * {@code javap} of the merged class shows both {@code getSupplier} and {@code hasSupplier} calling
 * {@code net.neoforged.neoforge.common.CommonHooks.getAttributesView()}, and the whole merged base names
 * {@code EntityAttributeCreationEvent} nowhere at all.
 *
 * <p>So a traditional MinecraftForge mod's attributes went into a map with no reader. The cost is not subtle:
 * {@code AttributeSupplier} is what gives a living entity its health and movement, and an entity without one is
 * rejected outright — {@code cursed_breeding} logged "Entity … has no attributes" 348 times in one boot and its
 * two mobs could not exist.
 *
 * <p>A VIEW rather than a copy, for the reason this project keeps rediscovering: both maps are themselves live
 * views that each ecosystem refills, and a snapshot taken at the wrong moment is a map that looks right and
 * answers with yesterday's content. {@code DefaultAttributes} only ever asks {@code get} and {@code containsKey}
 * of it, so the composition costs one extra map probe per miss and nothing else.
