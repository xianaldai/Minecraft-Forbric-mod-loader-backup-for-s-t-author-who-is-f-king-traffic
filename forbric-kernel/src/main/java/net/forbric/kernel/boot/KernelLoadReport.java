/**
 * Tells a player which mods did not finish loading, in a file they can find afterwards.
 *
 * <p>Until now the only record of a mod failing was one WARN line somewhere in a ten-thousand-line log. The
 * README's own advice for "the game crashes when it starts" is to remove half your mods and try again — a manual
 * binary search, offered because nothing else was on offer.
 *
 * <p>Forbric loads as much as it can rather than stopping at the first problem, which is a deliberate trade and
 * not in question here. The gap that follows from it is this one: a mod that fails after the pre-launch
 * dependency dialog has been shown produces no user-visible trace at all. This closes that, and only that.
 *
 * <p>Written next to {@code merge-report.txt} and in the same idiom: the system language, best-effort, and never
 * able to fail the boot it reports on. A shutdown hook covers the boot that dies before loading completes, which
 * is exactly the boot whose reader needs this file most.
