/**
 * The MinecraftForge half of the setup lifecycle must be reachable on a pack that has no NeoForge mod.
 *
 * <p>This is a shape test on the compiled method rather than a behaviour test, because the behaviour needs a
 * live carrier: every call inside {@code fireModSetupLifecycle} resolves game classes reflectively, so the only
 * thing assertable off-game is the CONTROL FLOW — and the control flow is exactly what was wrong. The method
 * opened with {@code if (mods.isEmpty()) return;} over {@code publishedNeoMods()}, which on a classic
 * MinecraftForge pack is empty while {@code publishedForgeMods()} is full, so all four MinecraftForge phases
 * and NeoForge's own {@code RegistrationEvents.init} were skipped with no log line anywhere.
 *
 * <p>The invariant it pins: the only {@code RETURN} that may precede the first {@code fireForgeSetupPhase} call
 * is the SIDE guard. The client's phases all live in {@code fireClientSetupLifecycle} now, common setup
 * included, so a return on {@code side.isClient()} is correct here — a return on "no NeoForge mods" is the
 * defect, and the two are told apart by what the branch tests.
