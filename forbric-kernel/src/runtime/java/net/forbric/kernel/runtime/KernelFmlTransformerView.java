/**
 * FML's {@code TransformingClassLoader}, as far as a NeoForge mod walks it to reach the live Mixin weaver — built
 * from the carrier's own classes and holding the kernel's weaver, so that what the mod writes back is what weaves.
 *
 * <h2>Who walks it</h2>
 *
 * <p>LibJF's mixin plugin ({@code libjf_unsafe_v0}): {@code (TransformingClassLoader)} the context loader, then by
 * reflection {@code classTransformer} → {@code processors} → {@code processors.get(ClassProcessorIds.MIXIN)} →
 * {@code FMLMixinClassProcessor.transformer}, which it wraps in its own {@code AsmTransformer} and writes back.
 * On NeoForge that processor reads the field again for every class, so from then on every class goes through
 * Mixin and then LibJF's {@code libjf:asm} patches (LibJF Data Manipulation's resource-pack hook is one). Under
 * the kernel the context loader is {@code ForbricClassLoader}, the cast failed, and LibJF logged "Could not
 * initialize LibJF ASM" and applied no patch at all.
 *
 * <h2>What is built, and what is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>Exactly that path and nothing beside it. {@code FMLMixinClassProcessor} and {@code TransformingClassLoader}
 * are allocated without a constructor: the real ones need FML's Mixin service and a module layer the kernel does
 * not have, and nothing here ever asks them to process, load or define a class — a guest only reads their fields.
 * {@code ClassProcessorSet} is allocated too, with only {@code processors} filled, rather than built by
 * {@code ClassProcessorSet.of}: that constructor registers a "Class Processors" crash-report section, and every
 * crash report would then list a processor set that never ran. {@code ClassTransformer} is built through its
 * public constructor, which only stores its arguments.
 *
 * <p>The processor's field is then what {@link MixinWeaverSlot} reads for every class, so a wrapper written into
 * it is the weaver from the next class on — and a guest that walks the view after another guest finds the first
 * guest's wrapper there, as on NeoForge.
 *
 * <h2>When it cannot be built</h2>
 *
 * <p>The real context loader comes back, and the guest's cast fails exactly as it did before this existed.
 * Allocating a {@code TransformingClassLoader} initialises {@code ModuleClassLoader}, whose static initialiser
 * needs java.lang.invoke opened; the kernel's launch profile does not open it, and
 * {@code ModuleClassLoaderInitInjector} is what lets that initialiser finish anyway. Nothing thrown while building
 * — {@code ExceptionInInitializerError} included — leaves this method: the caller is a guest's plugin, and it
 * runs while the kernel is defining a class.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.fmlTransformerView=off}: the real loader, always.
