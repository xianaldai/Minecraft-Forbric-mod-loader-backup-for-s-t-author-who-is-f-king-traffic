/**
 * Arbitrates TWO SEPARATE JARS that declare the SAME mod id — the case that appears the moment a Fabric modpack and
 * a NeoForge modpack are merged into one instance.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is not part of {@link MultiLoaderArbiter}.</b> That one arbitrates ONE jar declaring several loader
 * manifests, and is keyed by jar path; it cannot see two files sharing an id. The two arbitrations also have
 * opposite effects on the classpath: {@code suppressedFor(jar, mine)} means "this jar acts as one family" and the
 * jar STAYS on the classpath, because the winning family needs its classes. Cross-jar means the jar is superseded
 * by a different file and must come OFF, or the losing copy still shadows classes (first-URL-wins: 662 of the
 * Fabric Sodium jar's 777 classes were measured as shadowed by the NeoForge one) and still contributes its mixin
 * configs — which nothing dedupes by mixin CLASS, only by config NAME, with {@code required} stripped, so a double
 * apply is silent. Folding the two together would make {@code suppressedFor} mean two things.
 *
 * <p><b>Reading ids.</b> Forge family via {@link ForbricModDiscoverer}; Fabric via
 * {@link FabricModMetadataParser}, deliberately NOT the metadata-package reader — only the parser reads
 * {@code environment}, and the runtime Fabric scanner filters on it. Arbitrating with a reader blind to
 * {@code environment} would let a client-only Fabric jar win an id on a dedicated server and then be dropped by the
 * environment filter, leaving the mod loaded by NOBODY. Claims are made on the declared id only, never on
 * {@code provides} aliases — {@code sodium-fabric} provides {@code indium}, and an alias claim would suppress a
 * real Indium jar.
 *
 * <p>Composes with the per-jar arbiter: {@link MultiLoaderArbiter#ownerOf} runs first, and only the ids declared
 * under that ecosystem count, so a universal jar enters as exactly one claim.
 *
 * <p>Switches: {@code -Dforbric.crossJarArbitration=off} disables it entirely;
 * {@code -Dforbric.modOwner=sodium=fabric,lithostitched=neoforge} overrides individual mods;
 * {@code -Dforbric.multiLoaderPreference} (shared with {@link MultiLoaderArbiter}) sets the global order.
 * {@link DisabledMods}' {@code forbric-disabled.txt} is applied here too, with the switch on or off: it is the
 * player's own list of jars not to load, not an arbitration.

	 *
	 * <p>Deliberately not the top-level order. A duplicate there is two builds of a mod the USER chose, and the
	 * pack they built around it is the one whose glue is most likely intact. A nested jar is chosen by nobody: it
	 * is a library its parents happened to bundle, both families' parents call it, and only one copy of a class
	 * can exist. So the question is not "which build was this pack tested with" but "which build, when it is the
	 * only one, leaves the fewest callers talking to a method that does nothing".
	 *
	 * <p>That last clause is the whole difficulty, because a multi-loader library ships one build per loader and
	 * each build STUBS OUT the phases its own loader does not have. The stub is an empty method, not an error:
	 * the caller registers nothing, hears nothing, and dies much later somewhere else. Both defects below are
	 * that same shape, and between them they fix the order:
	 *
	 * <p><b>FORGE loses to FABRIC.</b> Xaero's {@code xaerolib} is nested by a Fabric minimap and a
	 * MinecraftForge world map. Its Fabric bootstrap sets {@code XaeroLib.client} from {@code onInitializeClient},
	 * which the kernel runs inside {@code Minecraft.<init>} — before any tick. Its MinecraftForge bootstrap sets
	 * the same field from {@code FMLClientSetupEvent}. Letting MinecraftForge win left the Fabric minimap's
	 * first-tick hook calling {@code XaeroLib.getClient()} on a null: "Cannot invoke
	 * XaeroLibClient.getBufferProvider() because the return value of XaeroLib.getClient() is null", at
	 * {@code CustomRenderTypes.applyFixedOrder}. Letting Fabric win produced a clean boot with BOTH mods up — the
	 * world map is a traditional-Forge {@code @Mod} and did not mind at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>FABRIC loses to NEOFORGE.</b> tr7zw's {@code transition} is nested by EntityCulling (Fabric, the
	 * {@code -fabric-} build) and NotEnoughAnimations (NeoForge, the {@code -neoforge-} build) — same id, same
	 * version 1.0.25, one host each, so nothing about the contest itself separates them. The two builds differ in
	 * exactly two of their 5,800 methods, and the Fabric one is
	 * {@code ModLoaderEventUtil.registerClientSetupListener(Runnable)}, whose entire Fabric body is {@code return}
	 * — Fabric has no client-setup phase. NotEnoughAnimations does ALL of its initialisation from that listener.
	 * With the Fabric copy loaded its {@code @Mod} constructor handed the runnable to an empty method, nothing
	 * was registered, nothing was logged, {@code NEABaseMod.config} stayed null, and twenty seconds later the
	 * first player tick threw "Cannot read field maxBlockingAngle" out of its own mixin and took the client with
	 * it. The other direction costs {@code ModLoaderUtil.disableDisplayTest}, stubbed in the NeoForge build and
	 * called by both hosts — a server-list version marker, cosmetic, and nothing waits on it.
	 *
	 * <p>So the loss is real either way and this is a default, not a law: {@code -Dforbric.modOwner=<id>=<ecosystem>}
	 * overrides it per mod and this knob replaces the order wholesale. What the order buys is that when a nested
	 * library is contested, the family that loses is the one whose callers lose the least.
