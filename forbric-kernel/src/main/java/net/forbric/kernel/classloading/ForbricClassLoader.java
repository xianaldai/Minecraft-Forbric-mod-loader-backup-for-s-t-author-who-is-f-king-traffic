 * <p>This replaces Fabric's Knot (and Forge's ModLauncher/securemodules) with one flat, JPMS-free loader. It is

 * runtime jar + mod jars) and parent-first for everything shared with the boot side (ASM, Mixin, logging, the
 * kernel boot classes) — see {@link DelegationPolicy}.

 * runs the {@code TransformChain} (Access, merged-base compat, the kernel redirectors) and, last, Mixin. A
 * {@code null}/identity return means "unchanged".
