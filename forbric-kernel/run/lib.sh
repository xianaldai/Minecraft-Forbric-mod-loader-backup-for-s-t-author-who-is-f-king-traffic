# inspect. So every gate's `pgrep -f ... || break` broke on its FIRST iteration and every `pkill -9 -f ...` was
# a no-op. The gates passed anyway — but only because a healthy server reaches "Stopping server" by itself. A
# server that HUNG hung the gate with it, forever, on `wait "$BOOTPID"`. (Measured: 17 minutes before someone
# noticed.) Kill the tree by pid instead, and leave the pid behind so an interrupted run can be reaped later.

# --- canary builds ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THESE NEED ANY CARE AT ALL. run/canary/ is written by four builder scripts and read by eight gates, and
# SIX of those gates rebuild the same Fabric canary themselves. While the gates ran one at a time that was only
# wasteful. Once they overlap it is two concrete faults:
#
#   * two runs of one builder `rm -rf` each other's scratch directory mid-compile;
#   * `jar --create --file run/canary/x.jar` leaves a partial file on disk for as long as it takes to write it,
#     and build-fabric-canary.sh additionally UNLINKED its output first — so a reader in another gate could
#     find no canary at all, or copy half of one into its mods/ and then fail to load it. Neither failure
#     mentions the canary; both read as a kernel regression.
#
# The two helpers below remove the need for a lock: give each invocation its own scratch, and put the finished
# jar in place with a single rename. Concurrent builders then all produce the same bytes and the last rename
# wins, while every reader sees one complete jar or the other.

# NOT via command substitution: a subshell would take the trap with it and delete the directory immediately.

# --- download caches ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS. gate-m13 and gate-m14 both `rm -rf` their rundir to get a clean world, and that also deletes
# the ~50 MB vanilla server jar their launcher downloaded on the previous run. So these two are the only gates
# that need Mojang / FabricMC to be reachable AND fast at gate time. Measured on this machine over one afternoon,
# that link swings between 30 KB/s and 2.2 MB/s and sometimes refuses TLS outright ("SSL peer shut down
# incorrectly"), which turned both gates red for reasons with nothing to do with the kernel: Paperclip failed the
# hash check on a truncated mojang_*.jar twice, at two different sizes, and fabric-installer timed out mid-read.
#
# Stashing the download outside the rundir keeps the wipe (clean world, clean config) while paying the download
# once. The stash is VERIFIED before it is put back, because the failure that motivated this cached a truncated
# jar and then failed on it every run until it was deleted by hand — a cache that can serve corruption is worse
