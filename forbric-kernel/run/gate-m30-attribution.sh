# M30 gate — a mod that loses PART of itself is named, with the reason, on every surface a player has.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. gate-m24 proves a mod that FAILS is named. This is the other, larger case: the mod loaded, and
# a piece of it — a mixin, a subscriber, a deferred task, its compile target — did not. Before Workstream J each
# of those was one WARN in a ten-thousand-line log that named a class and not a mod, and load-report.txt was
# written once, at load-complete, so a failure during world creation never reached it at all.
#
# Four attribution canaries beside two healthy ones, so each attribution is asserted on its own:
#   forbricmixincanary      UnfitMixin (left out by the fit check: its injector must inject — require = 1 — into a method
#                           the game lacks; without that require vanilla lacks it too, and native Mixin, and so the
#                           kernel, would drop just the injector) + ApplyFailingMixin (fails at apply on
#                           RegionFileStorage, a class first loaded at world creation — AFTER load-complete; one handler
#                           fits so the mixin is kept, and the refused one sits at a JUMP the fit check cannot prove
#                           Mixin meets, so it is Mixin that fails on it, not the fit check that takes it out first)
#   forbricsubscribercanary BrokenSubscriber (<clinit> throws)
#   forbricforgecanary      FluidSourceWaiter (Forge CreateFluidSourceEvent has no game hook)
#   forbricabicanary        compiled against net.neoforged.neoforge.event.ForbricVanishedEvent, absent here; its
#                           common-setup deferred task touches it (the bucket_of_frog shape)
#
# RED demonstrations (measured 2026-09-20: green 30/30; each switch fails exactly the checks named — 3, 4, 2, 2):
#   M30_EXTRA_JVM=-Dforbric.loadReportRewrite=off     the report is written once at load-complete, so 'ApplyFailingMixin
#                                                     failed to apply' never reaches the file, and no [Forbric/Load]
#                                                     line follows 'Done ('
#   M30_EXTRA_JVM=-Dforbric.mixinErrorAttribution=off no 'ApplyFailingMixin failed to apply' anywhere (Mixin's own
#                                                     report still prints; nobody is marked for it)
#   M30_EXTRA_JVM=-Dforbric.abiAudit=off              no AbiAudit line and no 'compiled against a different NeoForge'
#                                                     in the report — forbricabicanary is still named, by its
#                                                     deferred task (J5), which is why the check is on the reason
#   M30_EXTRA_JVM=-Dforbric.deadEventAudit=off        no DeadEvents line and no 'it listens for BlockEvent.CreateFluidSourceEvent'
