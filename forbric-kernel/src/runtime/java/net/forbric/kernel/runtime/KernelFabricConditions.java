/**
 * Gives {@code fabric:load_conditions} an evaluator again, because fabric-api's own two cannot run here.
 *
 * <h2>Why nothing evaluates them</h2>
 *
 * <p>fabric-api reads that key from exactly two mixins, and the merged base defeats both:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code RegistryLoadTaskPendingRegistrationMixin} injects at {@code Decoder.parse} inside
 *       {@code loadFromResource}. NeoForge's patch of that method replaced the call with {@code Codec.parse}
 *       (via {@code NeoForgeExtraCodecs.decodeOnly} and {@code ConditionalOps.createConditionalCodec}), so the
 *       anchor does not exist — and the kernel rewrites every guest config's {@code defaultRequire} to 0, so it
 *       SOFT-SKIPS. Silently.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SimpleJsonResourceReloadListenerMixin.skipData} targets
 *       {@code lambda$scanDirectory$0(Map, Identifier, Object)}; the merged base's is
 *       {@code (Identifier, Identifier, Map, Optional)}, because NeoForge's patch made the value optional and
 *       reordered the captures. Mixin rejects the class, taking the sibling injection with it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So every Fabric mod's conditional data file has loaded unconditionally on this kernel — a config toggle
 * that is supposed to gate content did nothing, and nothing said so. The companion repair
 * ({@link KernelNeoConditions}) stopped NeoForge's evaluator failing the whole world load over an id it does not
 * own; this is the other half, and it is the half that makes the answer come from the mod.
 *
 * <h2>Why one insertion is enough</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ConditionalOps} has four public factories and they all funnel into
 * {@code createConditionalCodecWithConditions(Codec, String)}. A constant-pool scan of the merged base finds
 * seven classes reaching them — the datapack-registry loader, {@code SimpleJsonResourceReloadListener} (both its
 * {@code scanDirectory} and its {@code scanDirectoryWithModifier}, which is the one recipes use), loot tables,
 * recipes, advancements and the datapack generator. Wrapping the funnel covers all of them; wrapping a call site
 * would have missed recipes.
 *
 * <h2>Why {@code Optional.empty()} is the right "no"</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because it is the "no" the consumers already speak. {@code RegistryLoadTask} turns an empty optional into
 * its {@code SKIPPED_ELEMENT_MARKER} and logs at DEBUG without adding a loading error;
 * {@code SimpleJsonResourceReloadListener} skips the file the same way. Rejecting an element is therefore not a
 * new mechanism, it is NeoForge's own.
 *
 * <p>Fabric's answer is taken BEFORE NeoForge's decoder runs, so for a file carrying both dialects with
 * different opinions, Fabric's wins. Every dual-dialect file in the mod sets measured here says the same thing
 * in both, so that ordering is stated rather than tested.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.fabricConditions=off} restores the previous behaviour, which is "everything loads".

	 * Turns a guest mixin's private "skip this file" sentinel into the one the merged consumer understands.
	 *
	 * <h2>The half-applied pair</h2>
	 *
	 * <p>fabric-api's {@code SimpleJsonResourceReloadListenerMixin} is two injectors that only work together. The
	 * producer is a {@code @WrapOperation} on {@code Codec.parse} inside {@code scanDirectory}: when a file's
	 * {@code fabric:load_conditions} say no, it returns {@code DataResult.success(SKIP_DATA_MARKER)}, where the
	 * marker is a bare {@code new Object()}. The consumer is an {@code @Inject} on {@code lambda$scanDirectory$0}
	 * that recognises the marker and cancels the map-put.
	 *
	 * <p>On the merged base the producer applies and the consumer does not. The merge left the class carrying TWO
	 * methods named {@code lambda$scanDirectory$0} — NeoForge's {@code (Identifier,Identifier,Map,Optional)} and
	 * vanilla's {@code (Codec,Identifier,Map,Object)} — and the live {@code invokedynamic} binds the first. So
	 * fabric's {@code @Inject}, written against the second, attaches to nothing, and the bare Object flows into
	 * {@code DataResult.ifSuccess} whose consumer casts it to {@code Optional}: ClassCastException, datapack load
	 * fails, "can't proceed with server load", and the server never starts.
	 *
	 * <p>It needs no unusual mod set. Any instance with fabric-api plus any mod shipping a condition-gated file
	 * under a plain {@code scanDirectory} listener — an advancement, a loot table — whose condition evaluates
	 * false will reach it.
	 *
	 * <h2>Why Optional.empty()</h2>
	 *
	 * <p>Because that is the merged consumer's OWN vocabulary for "this file's conditions were not met" — it is
	 * what the surviving lambda already does with an empty value, and it logs exactly that. The substitution says
	 * what fabric's unattached {@code skipData} would have said.
	 *
	 * <p>Anything non-{@code Optional} reaching this point is already fatal at the cast one instruction later, so
	 * this cannot cost a file that would otherwise have loaded. What it could do is hide a FUTURE producer-side
	 * defect behind a skip, which is what the warning is for: the class of the value is named, once.
	 */
	/**
	 * Stands in for {@code DataResult.ifSuccess} at the two readers, filtering the marker out on the way through.
	 *
	 * <p>It replaces the call rather than wrapping its receiver because of where the receiver sits: the
	 * {@code invokedynamic} that builds the consumer pops three captured values first, so the {@code DataResult}
	 * is buried under them and there is no instruction boundary at which it is on top. Swapping
